For example: Super Mario 64 and Zelda 64 were fully decompiled and a handful of other N64 games are in the process. I wonder if we could map which developers worked on these two games (maybe even guess who did what module) and then use that to more easily decompile any other game that had those developers working on it.\\nIf this gets really good, maybe we can dream of having a fully de-obfuscated and open source life. All the layers of binary blobs in a PC can finally be decoded. All the drivers can be open. Why not do the OS as well!

There is also a lot of variety with optimization level, compiler choice, and platform.\\nWhat is unclear to me is: why did the authors fine-tune the DeepSeek-Coder model?

Updates\\n2023.03.16\\nAdd\\nllm4decompile-6.7b-uo\\nmodel which is trained without prior knowledge of the optimization levels (O0~O3), the average re-executability is arond 0.21.\\n1. Introduction of LLM4Decompile and Decompile-Eval\\nOur objective is to create and release the first open-source LLM dedicated to decompilation, and to assess its capabilities by constructing the first decompilation benchmark focused on re-compilability and re-executable.\\nWe start by compiling a million C code samples from AnghaBench into assembly code using GCC with different configurations, forming a dataset of assembly-source pairs in 4 billion tokens. We then finetune the DeepSeek-Coder model, a leading-edge code LLM, using this dataset. Followed by constructing the evaluation benchmark, Decompile-Eval, based on HumanEval questions and test samples. Specifically, we formulate the evaluation from two perspectives: whether the decompiled code can recompile successfully, and whether it passes all assertions in the test cases.\\nFigure 1 presents the steps involved in our decompilation evaluation. First, the source code (denoted as src) is compiled by the GCC compiler with specific parameters, such as optimization levels, to produce the executable binary. This binary is then disassembled into assembly language (asm) using the objdump tool. The assembly instructions are subsequently decompiled to reconstruct the source code in a format that's readable to humans (noted as src'). To assess the quality of the decompiled code (src'), it is tested for its ability to be recompiled with the original GCC compiler (re-compilability) and for its functionality through test assertions (re-executability).\\n2. Evaluation Results\\nMetrics\\nRe-compilability\\nand\\nre-executability\\nserve as critical indicators in validating the effectiveness of a decompilation process. When decompiled code can be recompiled, it provides strong evidence of syntactic integrity. It ensures that the decompiled code is not just readable, but also adheres to the structural and syntactical standards expected by the compiler.\\nHowever, syntax alone does not guarantee semantic equivalence to the original pre-compiled program. Re-executability provides this critical measure of semantic correctness. By re-compiling the decompiled output and running the test cases, we assess if the decompilation preserved the program logic and behavior.\\nTogether, re-compilability and re-executability indicate syntax recovery and semantic preservation - both essential for usable and robust decompilation.\\nResults\\n3. How to Use The Model\\nOur LLM4Decompile includes models with sizes between 1.3 billion and 33 billion parameters, and we have made these models available on Hugging Face.\\nllm4decompile-1.3b\\nllm4decompile-6.7b\\nllm4decompile-33b\\nllm4decompile-6.7b-nsp\\nllm4decompile-6.7b-uo\\nNote: The NSP model is trained with assembly code, the average re-executability is arond 0.17.\\nNote: The unified optimization (UO) model is trained without prior knowledge of the optimization levels (O0~O3), the average re-executability is arond 0.21. The pre-processing of UO model is slightly different (no prior knowledge of the On), please check the\\nmodel page\\n.\\nHere give an example of how to use our model.\\nPreprocessing:\\ncompile the C code into binary, disassemble the binary into assembly instructions.\\nimport\\nsubprocess\\nimport\\nos\\nimport\\nre\\ndigit_pattern\\n=\\nr'\\\\b0x[a-fA-F0-9]+\\\\b'\\n# binary codes in Hexadecimal\\nzeros_pattern\\n=\\nr'^0+\\\\s'\\n#0s\\nOPT\\n=\\n[\\n\\\"O0\\\"\\n,\\n\\\"O1\\\"\\n,\\n\\\"O2\\\"\\n,\\n\\\"O3\\\"\\n]\\nfileName\\n=\\n'path/to/file'\\nwith\\nopen\\n(\\nfileName\\n+\\n'.c'\\n,\\n'r'\\n)\\nas\\nf\\n:\\n#original file\\nc_func\\n=\\nf\\n.\\nread\\n()\\nfor\\nopt_state\\nin\\nOPT\\n:\\noutput_file\\n=\\nfileName\\n+\\n'_'\\n+\\nopt_state\\ninput_file\\n=\\nfileName\\n+\\n'.c'\\ncompile_command\\n=\\nf'gcc -c -o\\n{\\noutput_file\\n}\\n.o\\n{\\ninput_file\\n}\\n-\\n{\\nopt_state\\n}\\n-lm'\\n#compile the code with GCC on Linux\\nsubprocess\\n.\\nrun\\n(\\ncompile_command\\n,\\nshell\\n=\\nTrue\\n,\\ncheck\\n=\\nTrue\\n)\\ncompile_command\\n=\\nf'objdump -d\\n{\\noutput_file\\n}\\n.o >\\n{\\noutput_file\\n}\\n.s'\\n#disassemble the binary file into assembly instructions\\nsubprocess\\n.\\nrun\\n(\\ncompile_command\\n,\\nshell\\n=\\nTrue\\n,\\ncheck\\n=\\nTrue\\n)\\ninput_asm\\n=\\n''\\nwith\\nopen\\n(\\noutput_file\\n+\\n'.s'\\n)\\nas\\nf\\n:\\n#asm file\\nasm\\n=\\nf\\n.\\nread\\n()\\nasm\\n=\\nasm\\n.\\nsplit\\n(\\n'Disassembly of section .text:'\\n)[\\n-\\n1\\n].\\nstrip\\n()\\nfor\\ntmp\\nin\\nasm\\n.\\nsplit\\n(\\n'\\n\\\\n\\n'\\n):\\ntmp_asm\\n=\\ntmp\\n.\\nsplit\\n(\\n'\\n\\\\t\\n'\\n)[\\n-\\n1\\n]\\n#remove the binary code\\ntmp_asm\\n=\\ntmp_asm\\n.\\nsplit\\n(\\n'#'\\n)[\\n0\\n].\\nstrip\\n()\\n#remove the comments\\ninput_asm\\n+=\\ntmp_asm\\n+\\n'\\n\\\\n\\n'\\ninput_asm\\n=\\nre\\n.\\nsub\\n(\\nzeros_pattern\\n,\\n''\\n,\\ninput_asm\\n)\\nbefore\\n=\\nf\\\"# This is the assembly code with\\n{\\nopt_state\\n}\\noptimization:\\n\\\\n\\n\\\"\\n#prompt\\nafter\\n=\\n\\\"\\n\\\\n\\n# What is the source code?\\n\\\\n\\n\\\"\\n#prompt\\ninput_asm_prompt\\n=\\nbefore\\n+\\ninput_asm\\n.\\nstrip\\n()\\n+\\nafter\\nwith\\nopen\\n(\\nfileName\\n+\\n'_'\\n+\\nopt_state\\n+\\n'.asm'\\n,\\n'w'\\n,\\nencoding\\n=\\n'utf-8'\\n)\\nas\\nf\\n:\\nf\\n.\\nwrite\\n(\\ninput_asm_prompt\\n)\\nDecompilation:\\nuse LLM4Decompile to translate the assembly instructions into C:\\nfrom\\ntransformers\\nimport\\nAutoTokenizer\\n,\\nAutoModelForCausalLM\\nimport\\ntorch\\nmodel_path\\n=\\n'arise-sustech/llm4decompile-1.3b'\\ntokenizer\\n=\\nAutoTokenizer\\n.\\nfrom_pretrained\\n(\\nmodel_path\\n)\\nmodel\\n=\\nAutoModelForCausalLM\\n.\\nfrom_pretrained\\n(\\nmodel_path\\n,\\ntorch_dtype\\n=\\ntorch\\n.\\nbfloat16\\n).\\ncuda\\n()\\nwith\\nopen\\n(\\nfileName\\n+\\n'_'\\n+\\nopt_state\\n+\\n'.asm'\\n,\\n'r'\\n)\\nas\\nf\\n:\\n#original file\\nasm_func\\n=\\nf\\n.\\nread\\n()\\ninputs\\n=\\ntokenizer\\n(\\nasm_func\\n,\\nreturn_tensors\\n=\\n\\\"pt\\\"\\n).\\nto\\n(\\nmodel\\n.\\ndevice\\n)\\nwith\\ntorch\\n.\\nno_grad\\n():\\noutputs\\n=\\nmodel\\n.\\ngenerate\\n(\\n**\\ninputs\\n,\\nmax_new_tokens\\n=\\n500\\n)\\nc_func_decompile\\n=\\ntokenizer\\n.\\ndecode\\n(\\noutputs\\n[\\n0\\n][\\nlen\\n(\\ninputs\\n[\\n0\\n]):\\n-\\n1\\n])\\n4.

Updates\\n2023.03.16\\nAdd\\nllm4decompile-6.7b-uo\\nmodel which is trained without prior knowledge of the optimization levels (O0~O3), the average re-executability is arond 0.21.\\n1. Introduction of LLM4Decompile and Decompile-Eval\\nOur objective is to create and release the first open-source LLM dedicated to decompilation, and to assess its capabilities by constructing the first decompilation benchmark focused on re-compilability and re-executable.\\nWe start by compiling a million C code samples from AnghaBench into assembly code using GCC with different configurations, forming a dataset of assembly-source pairs in 4 billion tokens. We then finetune the DeepSeek-Coder model, a leading-edge code LLM, using this dataset. Followed by constructing the evaluation benchmark, Decompile-Eval, based on HumanEval questions and test samples. Specifically, we formulate the evaluation from two perspectives: whether the decompiled code can recompile successfully, and whether it passes all assertions in the test cases.\\nFigure 1 presents the steps involved in our decompilation evaluation. First, the source code (denoted as src) is compiled by the GCC compiler with specific parameters, such as optimization levels, to produce the executable binary. This binary is then disassembled into assembly language (asm) using the objdump tool. The assembly instructions are subsequently decompiled to reconstruct the source code in a format that's readable to humans (noted as src'). To assess the quality of the decompiled code (src'), it is tested for its ability to be recompiled with the original GCC compiler (re-compilability) and for its functionality through test assertions (re-executability).\\n2. Evaluation Results\\nMetrics\\nRe-compilability\\nand\\nre-executability\\nserve as critical indicators in validating the effectiveness of a decompilation process. When decompiled code can be recompiled, it provides strong evidence of syntactic integrity. It ensures that the decompiled code is not just readable, but also adheres to the structural and syntactical standards expected by the compiler.\\nHowever, syntax alone does not guarantee semantic equivalence to the original pre-compiled program. Re-executability provides this critical measure of semantic correctness. By re-compiling the decompiled output and running the test cases, we assess if the decompilation preserved the program logic and behavior.\\nTogether, re-compilability and re-executability indicate syntax recovery and semantic preservation - both essential for usable and robust decompilation.\\nResults\\n3. How to Use The Model\\nOur LLM4Decompile includes models with sizes between 1.3 billion and 33 billion parameters, and we have made these models available on Hugging Face.\\nllm4decompile-1.3b\\nllm4decompile-6.7b\\nllm4decompile-33b\\nllm4decompile-6.7b-nsp\\nllm4decompile-6.7b-uo\\nNote: The NSP model is trained with assembly code, the average re-executability is arond 0.17.\\nNote: The unified optimization (UO) model is trained without prior knowledge of the optimization levels (O0~O3), the average re-executability is arond 0.21. The pre-processing of UO model is slightly different (no prior knowledge of the On), please check the\\nmodel page\\n.\\nHere give an example of how to use our model.\\nPreprocessing:\\ncompile the C code into binary, disassemble the binary into assembly instructions.\\nimport\\nsubprocess\\nimport\\nos\\nimport\\nre\\ndigit_pattern\\n=\\nr'\\\\b0x[a-fA-F0-9]+\\\\b'\\n# binary codes in Hexadecimal\\nzeros_pattern\\n=\\nr'^0+\\\\s'\\n#0s\\nOPT\\n=\\n[\\n\\\"O0\\\"\\n,\\n\\\"O1\\\"\\n,\\n\\\"O2\\\"\\n,\\n\\\"O3\\\"\\n]\\nfileName\\n=\\n'path/to/file'\\nwith\\nopen\\n(\\nfileName\\n+\\n'.c'\\n,\\n'r'\\n)\\nas\\nf\\n:\\n#original file\\nc_func\\n=\\nf\\n.\\nread\\n()\\nfor\\nopt_state\\nin\\nOPT\\n:\\noutput_file\\n=\\nfileName\\n+\\n'_'\\n+\\nopt_state\\ninput_file\\n=\\nfileName\\n+\\n'.c'\\ncompile_command\\n=\\nf'gcc -c -o\\n{\\noutput_file\\n}\\n.o\\n{\\ninput_file\\n}\\n-\\n{\\nopt_state\\n}\\n-lm'\\n#compile the code with GCC on Linux\\nsubprocess\\n.\\nrun\\n(\\ncompile_command\\n,\\nshell\\n=\\nTrue\\n,\\ncheck\\n=\\nTrue\\n)\\ncompile_command\\n=\\nf'objdump -d\\n{\\noutput_file\\n}\\n.o >\\n{\\noutput_file\\n}\\n.s'\\n#disassemble the binary file into assembly instructions\\nsubprocess\\n.\\nrun\\n(\\ncompile_command\\n,\\nshell\\n=\\nTrue\\n,\\ncheck\\n=\\nTrue\\n)\\ninput_asm\\n=\\n''\\nwith\\nopen\\n(\\noutput_file\\n+\\n'.s'\\n)\\nas\\nf\\n:\\n#asm file\\nasm\\n=\\nf\\n.\\nread\\n()\\nasm\\n=\\nasm\\n.\\nsplit\\n(\\n'Disassembly of section .text:'\\n)[\\n-\\n1\\n].\\nstrip\\n()\\nfor\\ntmp\\nin\\nasm\\n.\\nsplit\\n(\\n'\\n\\\\n\\n'\\n):\\ntmp_asm\\n=\\ntmp\\n.\\nsplit\\n(\\n'\\n\\\\t\\n'\\n)[\\n-\\n1\\n]\\n#remove the binary code\\ntmp_asm\\n=\\ntmp_asm\\n.\\nsplit\\n(\\n'#'\\n)[\\n0\\n].\\nstrip\\n()\\n#remove the comments\\ninput_asm\\n+=\\ntmp_asm\\n+\\n'\\n\\\\n\\n'\\ninput_asm\\n=\\nre\\n.\\nsub\\n(\\nzeros_pattern\\n,\\n''\\n,\\ninput_asm\\n)\\nbefore\\n=\\nf\\\"# This is the assembly code with\\n{\\nopt_state\\n}\\noptimization:\\n\\\\n\\n\\\"\\n#prompt\\nafter\\n=\\n\\\"\\n\\\\n\\n# What is the source code?\\n\\\\n\\n\\\"\\n#prompt\\ninput_asm_prompt\\n=\\nbefore\\n+\\ninput_asm\\n.\\nstrip\\n()\\n+\\nafter\\nwith\\nopen\\n(\\nfileName\\n+\\n'_'\\n+\\nopt_state\\n+\\n'.asm'\\n,\\n'w'\\n,\\nencoding\\n=\\n'utf-8'\\n)\\nas\\nf\\n:\\nf\\n.\\nwrite\\n(\\ninput_asm_prompt\\n)\\nDecompilation:\\nuse LLM4Decompile to translate the assembly instructions into C:\\nfrom\\ntransformers\\nimport\\nAutoTokenizer\\n,\\nAutoModelForCausalLM\\nimport\\ntorch\\nmodel_path\\n=\\n'arise-sustech/llm4decompile-1.3b'\\ntokenizer\\n=\\nAutoTokenizer\\n.\\nfrom_pretrained\\n(\\nmodel_path\\n)\\nmodel\\n=\\nAutoModelForCausalLM\\n.\\nfrom_pretrained\\n(\\nmodel_path\\n,\\ntorch_dtype\\n=\\ntorch\\n.\\nbfloat16\\n).\\ncuda\\n()\\nwith\\nopen\\n(\\nfileName\\n+\\n'_'\\n+\\nopt_state\\n+\\n'.asm'\\n,\\n'r'\\n)\\nas\\nf\\n:\\n#original file\\nasm_func\\n=\\nf\\n.\\nread\\n()\\ninputs\\n=\\ntokenizer\\n(\\nasm_func\\n,\\nreturn_tensors\\n=\\n\\\"pt\\\"\\n).\\nto\\n(\\nmodel\\n.\\ndevice\\n)\\nwith\\ntorch\\n.\\nno_grad\\n():\\noutputs\\n=\\nmodel\\n.\\ngenerate\\n(\\n**\\ninputs\\n,\\nmax_new_tokens\\n=\\n500\\n)\\nc_func_decompile\\n=\\ntokenizer\\n.\\ndecode\\n(\\noutputs\\n[\\n0\\n][\\nlen\\n(\\ninputs\\n[\\n0\\n]):\\n-\\n1\\n])\\n4.

People put it at <1% from much more recent testing by the very R.W.M. Jones you're replying to [0] and separate testing by others like Brendan Gregg [1b], whose post this is commenting on (and included [1b] in the Appendix as well), with similar accounts by others in the last couple years. Oh, and if you use flamegraph, you might want to check the repo for a familiar name.\\nSome programs, like Python, have reported worse, 2-7% [2], but there is traction on tackling that [1a] (see both rwmj's and brendangregg's replies to sibling comments, they've both done a lot of upstreamed work wrt. frame pointers, performance, and profiling).\\nAs has been frequently pointed out, the benefits from improved profiling cannot be understated, even a 10% cost to having frame pointers can be well worth it when you leverage that information to target the actual bottlenecks that are eating up your cycles. Plus, you can always disable it in specific hotspots later when needed, which is much easier than the reverse.\\nSomething, something, premature optimisation -- though in seriousness, this information benefits actual optimisation, exactly because we don't have the information and understanding that would allow truly universal claims, precisely because things like this haven't been available, and so haven't been widely used. We know frame pointers, from additional register pressure and extended function prologue/epilogue, can be a detriment in certain hotspots; that's why we have granular control. But without them, we often don't know which hotspots are actually affected, so I'm sure even the databases would benefit... though the \\\"my database is the fastest database\\\" problem has always been the result of endless micro-benchmarking, rather than actual end-to-end program performance and latency, so even a claimed \\\"10%\\\" drop there probably doesn't impact actual real-world usage, but that's a reason why some of the most interesting profiling work lately has been from ideas like causal profilers and continuous profilers, which answer exactly that.\\n[0]:\\nhttps://rwmj.wordpress.com/2023/02/14/frame-pointers-vs-dwar...\\n[1a]:\\nhttps://pagure.io/fesco/issue/2817#comment-826636\\n[1b]:\\nhttps://pagure.io/fesco/issue/2817#comment-826805\\n[2]:\\nhttps://discuss.python.org/t/the-performance-of-python-with-...\\nreply\\nbarrkel\\n1 hour ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nThis isn't an argument for a default.\\nreply\\nmenaerus\\n56 minutes ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nI was not even trying to make one.

I think this might be able to be fired by inspecting the code, but I think this might only be as good as a heuristic as there could be other `push %rbp` unrelated to the stack frame. I would love to hear if there's a better approach!\\n* I developed the solution Brendan mentions which allows faster, in-kernel unwinding without frame pointers using BPF [0]. This doesn't use DWARF CFI (the unwind info) as-is but converts it into a random-access format that we can use in BPF. He mentions not supporting JVM languages, and while it's true that right now it only supports JIT sections that have frame pointers, I planned to implement a full JVM interpreter unwinder. I have left Polar Signals since and shifted priorities but it's feasible to get a JVM unwinder to work in lockstep with the native unwinder.\\n* In an ideal world, enabling frame pointers should be done on a case-by-case. Benchmarking is key, and the tradeoffs that you make might change a lot depending on the industry you are in, and what your software is doing. In the past I have seen large projects enabling/disabling frame pointers not doing an in-depth assessment of losses/gains of performance, observability, and how they connect to business metrics. The Fedora folks have done a superb and rigorous job here.\\n* Related to the previous point, having a build system that enables you to change this system-wide, including libraries your software depends on can be awesome to not only test these changes but also put them in production.\\n* Lastly, I am quite excited about SFrame that Indu is working on. It's going to solve a lot of the problems we are facing right now while letting users decide whether they use frame pointers. I can't wait for it, but I am afraid it might take several years until all the infrastructure is in place and everybody upgrades to it.\\n- [0]:\\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20231222054207/https://www.polar...\\nreply\\nfelixge\\n1 hour ago\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nGreat comments, thanks for sharing.

From my\\nflame graphs\\npage:\\nCPU flame graph (partly broken)\\n(Click for original SVG.) This is pretty common and usually goes unnoticed as the\\nflame graph\\nlooks ok at first glance. But there are 15% of samples on the left, above \\\"[unknown]\\\", that are in the wrong place and missing frames. The problem is that this system has a default libc that has been compiled without frame pointers, so any stack walking stops at the libc layer, producing a partial stack that's missing the application frames. These partial stacks get grouped together on the left.\\nClick here for a longer explanation.\\nTo explain this example in more detail: The profiler periodically interrupts software execution, and for those disconnected stacks it happens to be the execution of the kernel software (\\\"vfs*\\\", \\\"ext*\\\", etc.). Once interrupted, the profiler begins at the top edge of the flame graph (or bottom edge if you are using the icicle layout) and then \\\"stack walks\\\" down through the rectangles to collect a stack trace. It finally gets through the kernel frames then steps through the syscall (sys_write()) to userspace, hits the libc syscall wrapper (__GI___libc_write()), then tries to resolve the symbol for the next frame but fails and records \\\"[unknown]\\\". It fails because of a compiler optimization where the frame pointer register is used to store data instead of the frame pointer, but it's just a number so the profiler is unaware this happened and tries to match that address to a function symbol and fails (it is therefore an unknown symbol). Then, the profiler is usually unable to walk any more frames because that data doesn't point to the next frame either (and likely doesn't point to any valid mapping, because to the profiler it's effectively a random number), so it stops before it can reach the application frames. There's probably several frames missing from that left disconnected tower, similar to the application frames you see on the right (this example happens to be the bash(1) shell). What happens if the random data is a valid pointer by coincidence? You usually get an extra junk frame. I've seen it where the random data ends up pointing to itself, so the profiler gets stuck in a loop and you get a tower of junk frames until perf hits its max frame limit.\\nOther types of profiling hit this more often.\\nOff-CPU flame graphs\\n, for example, can be dominated by libc read/write and mutex functions, so without frame pointers end up mostly broken. Apart from library code, maybe your application doesn't have frame pointers either, in which case everything is broken.\\nI'm posting about this problem now because Fedora and Ubuntu are releasing versions that fix it\\n, by compiling libc and more with frame pointers by default. This is great news as it not only fixes these flame graphs, but makes off-CPU flame graphs far more practical. This is also a win for continuous profilers (my employer, Intel, just\\nannounced\\none) as it makes customer adoption easier.\\nWhat are frame pointers?\\nThe x86-64 ABI\\ndocumentation\\nshows how a CPU register, %rbp, can be used as a \\\"base pointer\\\" to a stack frame, aka the \\\"frame pointer.\\\" I pictured how this is used to walk stack traces in my BPF book.\\nFigure 3.3: Stack Frame with\\nBase Pointer (\\nx86-64 ABI\\n)\\nFigure 2-6: Frame Pointer-based\\nStack Walking (\\nBPF book\\n)\\nThis stack-walking technique is commonly used by external profilers and debuggers, including Linux perf and eBPF, and ultimately visualized by flame graphs. However, the x86-64 ABI has a footnote [12] to say that this register use is optional:\\n\\\"The conventional use of %rbp as a frame pointer for the stack frame may be avoided by using %rsp\\n(the stack pointer) to index into the stack frame. This technique saves two instructions in the prologue and\\nepilogue and makes one additional general-purpose register (%rbp) available.\\\"\\n(Trivia: I had penciled the frame pointer function prologue and epilogue on my Netflix\\noffice wall\\n, lower left.)\\n2004: Their removal\\nIn 2004 a compiler developer, Roger Sayle, changed gcc to stop generating frame pointers,\\nwriting\\n:\\n\\\"The simple patch below tweaks the i386 backend, such that we now\\ndefault to the equivalent of \\\"-fomit-frame-pointer -ffixed-ebp\\\" on\\n32-bit targets\\\"\\ni386 (32-bit microprocessors) only have four general purpose registers, so freeing up %ebp takes you from four to five (or if you include %si and %di, from six to seven). I'm sure this delivered large performance improvements and I wouldn't try arguing against it. Roger cited two other reasons for this change: The desire to outperform Intel's icc compiler, and the belief that it didn't break debuggers (of the time) since they supported other stack walking techniques.\\n2005-2023: The winter of broken profilers\\nHowever, the change was then applied to x86-64 (64-bit) as well, which had over a dozen registers and didn't benefit so much from another. And there are debuggers/profilers that this change did break, more so today with the rise of eBPF, which didn't exist back then (typically system profilers, not language specific ones). As my former Sun Microsystems colleague Eric Schrock (nickname Schrock) wrote in\\nNovember 2004\\n:\\n\\\"On i386, you at least had the advantage of increasing the number of usable registers by 20%. On amd64, adding a 17th general purpose register isn't going to open up a whole new world of compiler optimizations. You're just saving a pushl, movl, an series of operations that (for obvious reasons) is highly optimized on x86. And for leaf routines (which never establish a frame), this is a non-issue. Only in extreme circumstances does the cost (in processor time and I-cache footprint) translate to a tangible benefit - circumstances which usually resort to hand-coded assembly anyway. Given the benefit and the relative cost of losing debuggability, this hardly seems worth it.\\\"\\nIn Schrock's conclusion:\\n\\\"it's when people start compiling /usr/bin/ without frame pointers that it gets out of control.\\\"\\nThis is exactly what happened on Linux, not just /usr/bin but also /usr/lib and application code! I'm sure there are people who are too new to the industry to remember the pre-2004 days when profilers would \\\"just work\\\" without OS and runtime changes.\\n2014: Java in Flames\\nBroken Java Stacks (2014)\\nWhen I joined Netflix in 2014, I found Java's lack of frame pointer support broke all application stacks (pictured in my 2014\\nSurge talk\\non the right). I ended up developing a fix for the JVM c2 compiler which Oracle reworked and added as the -XX:+PreserveFramePointer option in JDK8u60 (see my\\nJava in Flames\\npost for details [\\nPDF\\n]).\\nWhile that Java change led to discovering countless performance wins in application code, libc was still breaking some portion of the samples (as pictured in the example at the top of this post) and preventing off-CPU flame graphs. I started by compiling my own libc for production use with frame pointers, and then worked with Canonical to have one prebuilt for Ubuntu. For a while I was promoting the use of Canonical's libc6-prof, which was libc6 with frame pointers.\\n2015-2020: Overhead\\nAs part of production rollout I did many performance overhead tests, which I've described publicly before: The overhead of adding frame pointers to everything (libc and Java) was usually less than 1%, with one exception of 10%. That 10% was an unusual application that was generating stack traces over 1000 frames deep (via Groovy), so deep that it broke Linux's perf profiler and Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo (Red Hat) added the\\nkernel.perf_event_max_stack\\nsysctl just for this Netflix workload. It was also a virtual machine that lacked low-level hardware profiling capabilities, so I wasn't able to do cycle analysis to confirm that the 10% was entirely frame pointer-based.\\nThe actual overhead depends on your workload. Others have reported around 1% and around 2%. Microbenchmarks can be the worst, hitting 10%: This doesn't surprise me since they resolve to running a small funciton in a loop, and adding any instructions to that function can cause it to spill out of L1 cache warmth (or cache lines) causing a drop in performance. If I were analyzing such a microbenchmark, apart from observability anaylsis (cycles, instructions, PMU, PMCs, PEBS) there are also an experiment I'd like to try:\\nTo test the theory of I-cache spillover: Compile the microbenchmark with and without frame pointers and find the performance delta. Then flame graph the microbenchmark to understand the hot function. Then add some inline assembly to the hot function where you add enough NOPs to the start and end to mimic the frame pointer prologue and epilogue (I recommend writing them on your office wall in pencil), compile it without frame pointers, disassemble the compiled binary to confirm those NOPs weren't stripped, and now test that. If the performance delta is still large (10%) you've confirmed that it is due to cache effects, and anyone who was worked at this level in production will tell you that it's the straw that broke the camel's back. Don't blame the straw, in this case, don't blame the frame pointers. Adding\\nanything\\nwill cause the same effect. Having done this before, it reminds me of CSS programming: you make a little change here and everything breaks, and you spend hours chasing your own tail.\\nAnother extreme example of overhead was the Python scimark_sparse_mat_mult benchmark, which could reach 10%. Fortunately this was\\nanalyzed\\nby Andrii Nakryiko (Meta) who found it was a unusual case of a large function where gcc switched from %rsp offsets to %rbp-relative offsets, which took more bytes to store, causing performance issues. I've heard this has since been fixed so that Python can reenable frame pointers by default.\\nAs I've seen frame pointers help find performance wins ranging from 5% to 500%, the typical \\\"less than 1%\\\" cost (or even 1% or 2% cost) is easily justified. But I'd rather the cost be zero, of course! We may get there with future technologies I'll cover later. In the meantime, frame pointers are the most practical way to find performance wins today.\\nWhat about Linux on devices where there is no chance of profiling or debugging, like electric toothbrushes? (I made that up, AFAIK they don't run Linux, but I may be wrong!) Sure, compile without frame pointers. The main users of this change are enterprise Linux. Back-end servers.\\n2022: Upstreaming, first attempt\\nOther large companies with OS and perf teams (Meta, Google) hinted strongly that they had already enabled frame pointers for everything years earlier. (Google should be no surprise because they pioneered continuous profiling.) So at this point you had Google, Meta, and Netflix running their own libc with frame pointers and able to enjoy profiling capabilities that most other companies \\u2013 without dedicated OS teams \\u2013 couldn't get working. Can't we just upstream this so everyone can benefit?\\nThere's a bunch of difficulties when taking \\\"works well for me\\\" changes and trying to make them the default for everyone. Among the difficulties is that end-user companies don't have a clear return on the investment from telling their Linux vendor what they fixed, since they already fixed it. I guess the investment is quite small, we're talking about a single email, right?...Wrong! Your suggestion is now a\\n116-post thread\\nwhere everyone is sharing different opinions and demanding this and that, as we found out the hard way. For Fedora, one person requested:\\n\\\"Meta and/or Netflix should provide infrastructure for a side repository in which the change can be tested and benchmarked and the code size measured.\\\"\\n(Bear in mind that Netflix doesn't even use Fedora!)\\nJonathan Corbet, who writes the best Linux articles, summarized this in \\\"\\nFedora's tempest in a stack frame\\n\\\" that is so detailed that I feel PTSD when reading it. It's good that the Fedora community wants to be so careful, but I'd rather spend time discussing building something\\nbetter\\nthan frame pointers, perhaps involving ORC, LBR, eBPF, and other technologies, than so much worry about looking bad in kitchen-sink benchmarks that I wouldn't trust in the first place.\\n2023, 2024: Frame Pointers in Fedora and Ubuntu!\\nFedora\\nrevisited\\nthe proposal and has accepted it this time, making it the first distro to reenable frame pointers. Thank you!\\nUbuntu\\nhas also announced\\nframe pointers by default\\nin Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Thank you!\\nUPDATE: I've now heard that\\nArch Linux\\nis\\nalso\\nenabling frame pointers! Thanks Daan De Meyer (Meta).\\nWhile this fixes stack walking through OS libraries, you might find your application still doesn't support stack tracing, but that's typically much easier to fix. Java, for example, has the -XX:+PreserveFramePointer option. There were ways to get Golang to support frame pointers, but that became the default years ago. Just to name a couple of languages.\\n2034+: Beyond Frame Pointers\\nThere's more than one way to walk a stack. These could be separate blog posts, but I want to comment briefly on alternates:\\nLBR (Last Branch Record)\\n: Intel's hardware feature that was limited to 16 or 32 frames. Most application stacks are deeper, so this can't be used to build flame graphs, but it is better than nothing. I use it as a last resort as it gives me\\nsome\\nstack insights.\\nBTS (Branch Trace Store)\\n: Another Intel thing. Not so limited to stack depth, but has overhead from memory load/stores and BTS buffer overflow interrupt handling.\\nAET (Archetectural Event Trace)\\n: Another Intel thing. It's a\\nJTAG-based tracer\\nthat can trace low-level CPU, BIOS, and device events, and apparently can be used for stack traces as well. I haven't used it. (I spent years as a cloud customer where I couldn't access many HW-level things.) I hope it can be configured to output to main memory, and not just a physical debug port.\\nDWARF\\n: Binary debuginfo, has been used forever with debuggers. Doesn't exist for JIT'd runtimes like the Java JVM, and I don't really see any practical way to ever fix that. The overhead to walk DWARF is also too high, as it was designed for non-realtime use. Javier Honduvilla Coto (Polar Signals) did some interesting work using an eBPF\\nwalker\\nto reduce the overhead, but...Java.\\neBPF stack walking\\n: Mark Wielaard (Red Hat) demonstrated a Java JVM stack walker using SystemTap back at LinuxCon 2014, where an external tracer walked a runtime with no runtime support or help. Very cool. This can be done using eBPF as well. The performmance overhead could be too high, however, as it may mean a lot of user space reads of runtime internals depending on the runtime. It would also be brittle; such eBPF stack walkers should ship with the language code base and be maintained with it.\\nORC (oops rewind capability)\\n: The Linux kernel's new lightweight\\nstack unwinder\\nby Josh Poimboeuf (Red Hat) that has allowed newer kernels to remove frame pointers yet retain stack walking. You may be using ORC without realizing it; the rollout was smooth as the kernel profiler code was updated to support ORC (perf_callchain_kernel()->unwind_orc.c) at the same time as it was compiled to support ORC. Can't ORCs invade user space as well?\\nSFrames (Stack Frames)\\n: ...which is what\\nSFrames\\ndoes: lightweight user stack unwinding based on ORC. There have been recent talks to explain them by\\nIndu Bhagat\\n(Oracle) and\\nSteven Rostedt\\n(Google). I should do a blog post just on SFrames.\\nShadow Stacks\\n: A newer Intel and AMD security\\nfeature\\nthat can be configured to push function return addresses onto a separate HW stack so that they can be double checked when the return happens. Sounds like such a HW stack could also provide a stack trace, without frame pointers.\\n(And this isn't even all of them.)\\nDaan De Meyer (Meta) did a nice summary as well of different stack walkers on the\\nFedora wiki\\n.\\nSo what's next? Here's my guesses:\\n2029: Ubuntu and Fedora release new versions with SFrames for OS components (including libc) and ditches frame pointers again. We'll have had five years of frame pointer-based performance wins and new innovations that make use of user space stacks (e.g., better automated bug reporting), and will hit the ground running with SFrames.\\n2034: Shadow stacks have been enabled by default for security, and then are used for all stack tracing.\\nConclusion\\nI could say that times have changed and now the original 2004 reasons for omitting frame pointers are no longer valid in 2024. Those reasons were that it improved performance significantly on i386, that it didn't break the debuggers of the day (prior to eBPF), and that competing with another compiler (icc) was deemed important. Yes, times have indeed changed. But I should note that one engineer, Eric Schrock, claimed that it didn't make sense back in 2004 either when it was applied to x86-64, and I agree with him. Profiling has been broken for 20 years and we've only now just fixed it.\\nFedora\\nand\\nUbuntu\\nhave now returned frame pointers, which is great news. People should start running these releases in 2024 and will find that\\nCPU flame graphs\\nmake more sense,\\nOff-CPU flame graphs\\nwork for the first time, and other new things become possible. It's also a win for continuous profilers, as they don't need to convince their customers to make OS changes to get profiles to fully work.\\nThanks\\nThe online threads about this change aren't even everything, there's been many discussions, meetings, and work put into this, not just for frame pointers but other recent advances including ORC and SFrames. Special thanks to Andrii Nakryiko (Meta), Daan De Meyer (Meta), Davide Cavalca (Meta), Ian Rogers (Google), Steven Rostedt (Google), Josh Poimboeuf (Red Hat), Arjan Van De Ven (Intel), Indu Bhagat (Oracle), Mark Shuttleworth (Canonical), Jon Seager (Canonical), Oliver Smith (Canonical), Javier Honduvilla Coto (Polar Signals), Mark Wielaard (Red Hat), Ben Cotton (Red Hat), and many others (see the Fedora discussions). And thanks to Schrock.\\nAppendix: Fedora\\nFor reference, here's my writeup for the Fedora\\nchange\\n:\\nI enabled frame pointers at Netflix, for Java and glibc, and summarized the effect in BPF Performance Tools (page 40):\\n\\\"Last time I studied the performance gain from frame pointer omission in our production environment, it was usually less than one percent, and it was often so close to zero that it was difficult to measure. Many microservices at Netflix are running with the frame pointer reenabled, as the performance wins found by CPU profiling outweigh the tiny loss of performance.\\\"\\nI've spent a lot of time analyzing frame pointer performance, and I did the original work to add them to the JVM (which became -XX:+PreserveFramePoiner). I was also working with another major Linux distro to make frame pointers the default in glibc, although I since changed jobs and that work has stalled. I'll pick it up again, but I'd be happy to see Fedora enable it in the meantime and be the first to do so.\\nWe need frame pointers enabled by default because of performance. Enterprise environments are monitored, continuously profiled, and analyzed on a regular basis, so this capability will indeed be put to use. It enables a world of debugging and new performance tools, and once you find a 500% perf win you have a different perspective about the <1% cost. Off-CPU flame graphs in particular need to walk the pthread functions in glibc as most blocking paths go through them; CPU flame graphs need them as well to reconnect the floating glibc tower of futex/pthread functions with the developers code frames.\\nI see the comments about benchmark results of up to 10% slowdowns. It's good to look out for regressions, although in my experience all benchmarks are wrong or deeply misleading. You'll need to do cycle analysis (PEBS-based) to see where the extra cycles are, and if that makes any sense. Benchmarks can be super sensitive to degrading a single hot function (like \\\"CPU benchmarks\\\" that really just hammer one function in a loop), and if extra instructions (function prologue) bump it over a cache line or beyond L1 cache-warmth, then you can get a noticeable hit. This will happen to the next developer who adds code anyway (assuming such a hot function is real world) so the code change gets unfairly blamed. It will only regress in this particular scenario, and regression is inevitable. Hence why you need the cycle analysis (\\\"active benchmarking\\\") to make sense of this.\\nThere was one microservice that was an outlier and had a 10% performance loss with Java frame pointers enabled (not glibc, I've never seen a big loss there). 10% is huge. This was before PMCs were available in the cloud, so I could do little to debug it. Initially the microservice ran a \\\"flame graph canary\\\" instance with FPs for flame graphs, but the developers eventually just enabled FPs across the whole microservice as the gains they were finding outweighed the 10% cost. This was the only noticeable (as in, >1%) production regression we saw, and it was a microservice that was bonkers for a variety of reasons, including stack traces that were over 1000 frames deep (and that was after inlining! Over 3000 deep without. ACME added the perf_event_max_stack sysctl just so Netflix could profile this microservice, as the prior limit was 128). So one possibility is that the extra function prologue instructions add up if you frequently walk 1000 frames of stack (although I still don't entirely buy it). Another attribute was that the microservice had over 1 Gbyte of instruction text (!), and we may have been flying close to the edge of hardware cache warmth, where adding a bit more instructions caused a big drop. Both scenarios are debuggable with PMCs/PEBS, but we had none at the time.\\nSo while I think we need to debug those rare 10%s, we should also bear in mind that customers can recompile without FPs to get that performance back. (Although for that microservice, the developers chose to eat the 10% because it was so valuable!) I think frame pointers should be the default for enterprise OSes, and to opt out if/when necessary, and not the other way around. It's possible that some math functions in glibc should opt out of frame pointers (possibly fixing scimark, FWIW), but the rest (especially pthread) needs them.\\nIn the distant future, all runtimes should come with an eBPF stack walker, and the kernel should support hopping between FPs, ORC, LBR, and eBPF stack walking as necessary. We may reach a point where we can turn off FPs again. Or maybe that work will never get done. Turning on FPs now is an improvement we can do, and then we can improve it more later.\\nFor some more background: Eric Schrock (my former colleague at Sun Microsystems) described the then-recent gcc change in 2004 as \\\"a dubious optimization that severely hinders debuggability\\\" and that \\\"it's when people start compiling /usr/bin/* without frame pointers that it gets out of control\\\" I recommend reading his post: [0].\\nThe original omit FP change was done for i386 that only had four general-purpose registers and saw big gains freeing up a fifth, and it assumed stack walking was a solved problem thanks to gdb(1) without considering real-time tracers, and the original change cites the need to compete with icc [1]. We have a different circumstance today -- 18 years later -- and it's time we updated this change.\\n[0] http://web.archive.org/web/20131215093042/https://blogs.oracle.com/eschrock/entry/debugging_on_amd64_part_one\\n[1] https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2004-08/msg01033.html\\nClick here for Disqus comments (ad supported).\\nYou are welcome to comment here, but I've been meaning to switch comment systems one day and I don't know yet if I can preserve existing comments (I'll try to find a way).\\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\\ncomments powered by Disqus.\\ncomments powered by\\nDisqus\\nSite Navigation\\nSystems Performance 2nd Ed.\\nBPF Performance Tools book\\nRecent posts:\\n17 Mar 2024 \\u00bb\\nThe Return of the Frame Pointers\\n10 Mar 2024 \\u00bb\\neBPF Documentary\\n28 Apr 2023 \\u00bb\\neBPF Observability Tools Are Not Security Tools\\n01 Mar 2023 \\u00bb\\nUSENIX SREcon APAC 2022: Computing Performance: What's on the Horizon\\n17 Feb 2023 \\u00bb\\nUSENIX SREcon APAC 2023: CFP\\n02 May 2022 \\u00bb\\nBrendan@Intel.com\\n15 Apr 2022 \\u00bb\\nNetflix End of Series 1\\n09 Apr 2022 \\u00bb\\nTensorFlow Library Performance\\n19 Mar 2022 \\u00bb\\nWhy Don't You Use ...\\n26 Sep 2021 \\u00bb\\nThe Speed of Time\\n06 Sep 2021 \\u00bb\\nZFS Is Mysteriously Eating My CPU\\n30 Aug 2021 \\u00bb\\nAnalyzing a High Rate of Paging\\n27 Aug 2021 \\u00bb\\nSlack's Secret STDERR Messages\\n05 Jul 2021 \\u00bb\\nUSENIX LISA2021 Computing Performance: On the Horizon\\n03 Jul 2021 \\u00bb\\nHow To Add eBPF Observability To Your Product\\n15 Jun 2021 \\u00bb\\nUSENIX LISA2021 BPF Internals (eBPF)\\n04 Jun 2021 \\u00bb\\nAn Unbelievable Demo\\n29 May 2021 \\u00bb\\nMoving my US tech job to Australia\\n23 May 2021 \\u00bb\\nWhat is Observability\\n09 May 2021 \\u00bb\\nPoor Disk Performance\\nBlog index\\nAbout\\nRSS\\nBrendan's site:\\nStart Here\\nHomepage\\nBlog\\nSys Perf book\\nBPF Perf book\\nLinux Perf\\neBPF Tools\\nperf Examples\\nPerf Methods\\nUSE Method\\nTSA Method\\nOff-CPU Analysis\\nActive Bench.\\nWSS Estimation\\nFlame Graphs\\nHeat Maps\\nFrequency Trails\\nColony Graphs\\nDTrace Tools\\nDTraceToolkit\\nDtkshDemos\\nGuessing Game\\nSpecials\\nBooks\\nOther Sites\\nCopyright 2024 Brendan Gregg.\\nAbout this blog\"}\n",

In English, they roughly equate to \\u201cBecause so much money creeps into my sack, the whole world climbs into my hole\\u201d, left, and \\u201cBecause the world is so deceitful, I go in mourning\\u201d, right.\\n\\u201cI wear mourning, seeing the world in which so much deceit abounds.\\u201d So laments\\nThe Misanthrope\\nas he skulks along, withdrawn emotionally and sartorially, in a deep-hooded cloak. But world-weariness does not amount to wisdom in Jan Wierix\\u2019s engraving; rather than serving as a hermetic sanctum, the misanthrope\\u2019s heavy garment only blinds him to the fact that the world \\u2014 personified as a waddling orb \\u2014 has caught up to him to steal his purse.\\nThe Misanthrope\\nbelongs to a series of twelve engraved roundels depicting literal enactments of Flemish proverbs, each concerned with some aspect of human folly or treachery. Seven of the scenes, collected below, were engraved by Wierix; the precise authorship of the remaining five remains mysterious. Rather like many actual proverbs, the\\nProverbs\\u2019\\nmotifs look backward to origins that are uncertain in some respects while maintaining vitality through repetition, reuse, and appropriation.\\nIn addition to\\nThe Misanthrope,\\nthe other six scenes engraved by Wierix include: a man shooting arrows into the ground; a hawker praising his own wares; a man playing a jawbone like a fiddle; a crowd crawling into a rich man\\u2019s asshole; a husband berated by his wife; and mendicant monks begging at unresponsive homes. The five more obscure scenes depict: the\\nblind leading the blind\\n; a man warming himself by his neighbor\\u2019s house fire; a fool perched on an egg; a horse frightened by an ambulant bale of hay; and\\nan agitated peddler seated by a bride\\n. To a contemporary anglophone audience, some of the scenes are comprehensible; for instance, the archer seems to symbolize the expenditure of energy on futile endeavors, similar to \\u201cspinning one\\u2019s wheels\\u201d. Others refer to specific Flemish proverbs of varying obscurity.\\nIt is not known who provided the initial designs for these engravings. Pieter Bruegel the Elder had long been considered the originator of the compositions, and in fact Bruegel had supplied designs for mass-market prints early in his career. He also maintained an interest \\u2014 popular in the sixteenth-century Low Countries \\u2014 in literal renderings of proverbs, most famously in his painting,\\nDutch Proverbs\\n, a busy scene in which around 126 proverbs are enacted before the spectator. Wierix\\u2019s\\nMisanthrope\\nunmistakably references\\nBruegel\\u2019s independent painting of the subject\\n, and the roundel format and the count of the prints echo the circular vignettes of Bruegel\\u2019s\\nTwelve Proverbs\\npanel, although none of the scenes in that painting are repeated in the prints. The prints only demonstrate that the engravers, Wierix and a possible collaborator, were familiar with some of Bruegel\\u2019s imagery, not that Bruegel himself was an active participant in their production. Indeed, Walter Gibson has noted that a set of drawings initially thought to be designs\\nfor\\nthe roundels, are now considered to have been made\\nafter\\nthem, and that eleven of the twelve engravings (\\nThe Misanthrope\\nbeing the one exception) may well have been designed by Wierix himself or someone else working with him.\\nNevertheless, all of the engravings in the series could be described as Brugelian in their attitude and style. In addition to directly referencing an artist\\u2019s known works, imitating or attempting to elicit another artist\\u2019s manner \\u2014 even in the creation of original compositions\\nnot\\nsourced from that artist\\u2019s oeuvre \\u2014 was a deliberate artistic practice in the sixteenth century. Artists and publishers kept close track of the print-buying public\\u2019s responses to their collective offerings. If a particular artist\\u2019s work became popular, it was common for others to create images in a similar vein. Indeed, none other than Bruegel himself began his career designing prints in the \\u201cmode\\u201d of a popular, elder artist:\\nHieronymus Bosch\\n.\\nBruegel haunts the entire\\nProverbs\\nseries even though he neither conceived of it nor intentionally supplied its designs. His spectral presence affected their reception and future iterations. Several of the\\nProverbs\\nwere\\nreformulated\\nin\\nlater prints\\n, and\\ntwo painted versions of the crawling brownnosers\\nwere created by none other than Bruegel\\u2019s son, Pieter Bruegel the Younger.\\nText by\\nMiya Tokumitsu\\nMedium\\nImages\\nTheme\\nWisdom\\nCustoms & Culture\\nStyle\\nPrintmaking & Line\\nEpoch\\n16th Century\\nTags\\nproverbs\\n6\\nPieter Bruegel the Elder\\n2\\nengravings\\n7\\nSource\\nRijksmuseum\\nMore\\nRijksmuseum\\ncontent on PDR (\\n31\\n)\\nUnderlying Work Rights\\nPD Worldwide\\nDigital Copy Rights\\nNo Additional Rights\\nLabelled\\nCC0 license\\nby source\\nSee their general\\nrights page\\nWe offer this info as\\nguidance only\\nDownload\\nRight click on image or see source for higher res\\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\\n\\u201cThe music of the rich is always pleasant, even if played on a jawbone\\u201d\\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\\n\\u201cEvery peddler praises his own wares\\u201d\\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\\n\\u201cKnocking at a deaf man\\u2019s door\\u201d\\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\\n\\u201cBecause so much money creeps into my sack, the whole world climbs into my hole\\u201d\\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\\n\\u201cBecause the world is so deceitful, I go in mourning\\u201d\\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\\n\\u201cTo shoot all one\\u2019s bolts\\u201d\\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\\n\\u201cA whistling woman and a crowing hen are neither fit for God nor men\\u201d\\nPublished\\nMar 14, 2024\\nIf You Liked This\\u2026\\nGet Our Newsletter\\nOur latest content, your inbox, every fortnight\\nPrivacy Policy\\nMore Info\\nHP\\nBecome a Friend of the PDR\\nWe rely on our annual donors to keep the project alive.

(2) Using an autoregressive model, predict action_t based on scene_t. (3) The issue is because we rely on teacher forcing, the error accumulates, causing the model to go out of whack after 10 seconds.\\nI'm just making stuff up, but I'm assuming this is because of teacher forcing itself? LLMs for eg model sentences by predicting the next word, but retains the past state via the KV cache. Unsure if these systems have a KV cache equivalency? I'm assuming LLMs are in a different regime due to the sheer amount of data as well.\\nAlso I guess a simulation based system could work - ie by going around teacher forcing, and instead doing generation every say 30 steps, and making the dataset itself larger by training on the errors themselves. Sadly this means one has to make the simulation system.

It would drive for maybe 10 seconds, but then\\nerror would accumulate\\nand it would drift to one side of the lane or the other (funny enough, it did show reluctance to cross the lane line, but it was unusable as an ADAS system)\\ncomma\\u2019s first solution was a model that predicted lane position.\\nf_lane(img_t) -> (left_lane_pos_t, right_lane_pos_t)\\nWhile that alone couldn\\u2019t drive a car (especially not around turns), it functioned as a unbiased correction for the steering angle model, where\\n\\u03b1\\nis the correction factor.\\n(f_steerangle(img_t) - \\u03b1*f_lane(img_t).mean()) -> steerangle_t\\nThis was basically shipped in the first version of\\nopenpilot\\n.\\nOne major issue this struggled with was ground truthing the lane line model. Unlike steering angle, which has a simple sensor to measure it, \\u201clane lines\\u201d don\\u2019t have a clear definition.

We have extended this to removing explicit use of cars with\\nexperimental mode\\n, but some of our hand coded assumptions break down a bit more in the longitudinal case vs the lateral case.\\nFunny enough, things have come full circle, and we think we have a solution to behavioral cloning.

A lot of house building isn\\u2019t amenable to mass manufacture, so mass manufacturing the parts that are doesn\\u2019t speed up the overall process that much. Maybe it\\u2019s different in the Midwest, but in Maryland virtually every house has a basement. Our neighbor has a modular home (a nice one with two stories and three bedrooms\\u2014looks just like a stick built house) and they wanted a basement too. Grading the plot, digging out the basement, and dealing with drainage and whatnot takes a lot of time and skilled labor. The actual framing and finishing proceeds surprisingly quickly in comparison. Then, electrical, plumbing, insulation, HVAC, and other skilled trades take forever and cost a fortune.

The land beneath it is valued at more than double the actual house.\\nBuilt in 1949, it\\u2019s not the only mid-century home in the neighborhood. But this is no ranch house, cottage, or Craftsman. It\\u2019s a Lustron: the failed house of the future.\\nIts boxy, pale yellow exterior is made from steel panels, each measuring about two feet. Along with thousands of other components \\u2014 used for steel cabinets, steel ceiling tiles, a steel frame \\u2014 they were mass-produced and shipped from a factory in Ohio and assembled on-site into a home.\\nA Lustron house in Dallas, built in 1949. (Mark Dent/The Hustle)\\nSeventy-five years ago, Dallas residents paid 25 cents for tours. Magazine ads described the Lustron as \\u201cthe house America has been waiting for.\\u201d The Harry Truman administration hoped Lustrons would be as ubiquitous as Fords or Chryslers: an affordable housing solution for millions of middle-class Americans.\\nBut only\\n~2.5k\\nLustrons were ever built. Out of hundreds of thousands of homes that line Dallas\\u2019 sprawling streets, this is the only one. The house meant to change American life ended as a brief, failed social experiment.\\nWould today\\u2019s America, reeling from a yearslong housing affordability crisis, be better off if the experiment had worked?\\nThe idea to make houses as quickly as cars\\nBefore he manufactured material for houses, Lustron founder\\nCarl Strandlund\\nmade material for tanks.\\nStrandlund was a broad-shouldered Swedish immigrant, a serial inventor who favored brown suits with white shirts and green ties. During World War II, he devised a new technique for treating armor plates while working for the Chicago Vitreous Enamel Products Company. The Strandlund method reportedly dropped production time for treating these plates from 15 hours to seven minutes.\\nStrandlund\\u2019s most famous invention, however, hinged on his ability to bend the ears of Washington, DC, bureaucrats.\\nIn 1946, Chicago Vitreous Enamel sent Strandlund to Washington to convince federal officials to provide the company steel for developing\\na porcelain-enameled steel material\\nit called Lustron (luster on steel). Chicago Vitreous intended to use it on gas stations for Standard Oil and office buildings for Kraft.\\nBut\\nWilson Wyatt\\n, a member of Truman\\u2019s cabinet charged with stimulating the dormant housing market, told him gas stations and Kraft were not a priority. He asked if Strandlund could use the same material to make houses.\\nThe inventor, who\\u2019d never built an apartment, much less a house, quickly pulled a few sketches of homes from his briefcase. Soon after, he set up a prototype in Hinsdale, Illinois, for federal officials to visit and carved out a new division within Chicago Vitreous, the Lustron Corporation.\\nCarl Strandlund poses with components of a Lustron home. (Via\\nLustron.org\\n)\\nStrandlund believed that the Lustron Corporation could tackle America\\u2019s housing shortage by mass-producing steel modular homes \\u2014 Lustrons \\u2014 for GIs returning from World War II and their families.\\nThe typical Lustron had ~1k square feet of space, five rooms (including two bedrooms), eight closets, central heating, a dishwasher, sliding pocket doors, and built-in cabinets.\\nThe cost for the structure was an estimated\\n~$7k\\n(\\n$91k today\\n), including the price for a lot and assembly by a 20-man crew. (The\\naverage asking price\\nfor a home in 1950 was\\n$11k\\n, the average size ~1k square feet.) A nationwide network of dealers would sell Lustrons in local markets.\\nAt just one plant, the company intended to pump out 100-150 houses per day, or\\n400k\\nper year, the mass scale enabling lower production costs and cheap selling prices.\\n\\u201cIf we can use mass production on an assembly line basis so [successfully] for automobiles and airplanes, why not houses?\\u201d Strandlund once said.\\nMore radically, Strandlund believed in a homebuying philosophy of consumption rather than investment. He wanted Americans to treat Lustrons like cars, not appreciating assets. The corporation planned to roll out new models of the Lustron every year, including three-bedroom and four-bedroom homes, so families could trade up as they desired. The older homes would be sold at a discount.\\nLustrons would be abundant rather than scarce, \\u201cso that eventually,\\u201d noted one reporter, \\u201cevery family in the United States would have a home of some sort.\\u201d\\nOn June 30, 1947, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) committed a\\n$15.5m\\nloan (\\n~$220m today\\n) to the Lustron Corporation. Later, an unnamed federal official would explain his reasoning for backing the Lustron to the\\nSt. Louis Post-Dispatch\\n.\\n\\u201cIt probably will cost about 30 cents per person in the United States to find out if we can mass produce this home. Doesn\\u2019t that seem reasonable in view of [the] public benefit that will accrue?\\u201d\\nThe rise and fall of the Lustron\\nIn 1948, the Lustron was ready for primetime. Strandlund believed the company would sell\\n17k homes\\nthat year.\\nIn Manhattan, New Yorkers gawked at a showcase Lustron planted at 52nd and Sixth, not far from Radio City Music Hall and MoMA. A Lustron model in the St. Louis suburbs attracted 35k visitors in two weeks.\\nIt\\u2019s not that Americans had never seen modular and prefabricated homes. They\\u2019d dotted America\\u2019s housing landscape since the early 20th century. Sears\\nsold some 75k houses\\nfrom its famed catalog. In the Depression years, private enterprises, universities, and government groups like the Tennessee Valley Authority\\nattempted to build\\neconomically efficient prefabricated structures.\\nMetal walls in a Lustron in upstate New York. (Albany Times Union/Hearst Newspapers via Getty Images)\\nBut prefabs were often cheap and flimsy, and Americans never much liked them. A poll from 1946 revealed just\\n16% of Americans\\nwanted to live in a prefab house. Strandlund believed the Lustron was different.\\nHe referred to it as a \\u201cfactory-built home, not a so-called \\u2018prefabricated house.\\u2019\\u201d Its defining characteristic \\u2014 its steel bones and exterior \\u2014 meant the houses were sturdier, not to mention fireproof, waterproof, and even vermin-proof.\\nCleaning would be minimal, about the same as washing a car. The Lustron maximized space with built-in closets and storage.\\nThe design conveyed the idea that people would \\u201chave more time\\u201d to live their lives and cultivate \\u201ca prosperous future,\\u201d says\\nDiane Dias De Fazio\\n, a housing and historic preservation expert who once set out to document every Lustron in Ohio. Potential buyers saw a glossy, porcelain-enameled finish atop durable steel, a potent symbol for how they viewed America after the war.\\nUnfortunately, the metallic sheen belied a troubled business and regulatory landscape.\\nThe Lustron\\u2019s Ohio factory, which was roughly the size of two dozen football fields, ran on custom equipment that took longer than expected to procure and develop. It took six months just to design a trailer to store the house\\u2019s components, which numbered ~3k, for delivery.\\nMany components got lost during the shipping process, causing delays. The company also struggled to train and hire assembly workers in local markets.\\nSome cities, bogged down by politics, did not update building codes to allow for steel housing, effectively banning Lustrons.\\nComponents for a Lustron home, out for delivery. (Courtesy of Jean Fetters-Connor/Lustron Research)\\nThe complications led the Lustron Corporation to increase the prices of homes, which went for closer to\\n$10k-$11k\\nthan the anticipated $7k. And that still wasn\\u2019t enough for the company\\u2019s bottom line.\\nThe Lustron Corporation needed to produce 35-40 houses a day to break even and keep its housing affordable, giving it no chance to build momentum slowly. The company either needed to be extremely popular and efficient right away \\u2014 attaining enough production and revenue to cover costs \\u2014 or receive infusions of cash to stay afloat.\\nThe federal government initially loaned\\n$15.5m\\n, in 1947, followed by another\\n$10m\\nin 1948 and\\n$7m\\nin early 1949 (for a total of ~$400m in today\\u2019s dollars). But when the company failed to deliver on its promises (by one count it manufactured\\njust seven homes\\nin the first few months of 1948) or pay back any of the loans, Uncle Sam started to lose his patience.\\n\\u201cI have only seen one of them,\\u201d an Arkansas senator\\nremarked\\nat a hearing of the RFC in June 1949, \\u201cbut it sort of reminds you of a bathtub.\\u201d\\nA representative from Kansas demanded a congressional investigation, asserting he\\u2019d heard Lustron had produced $3m in homes nobody wanted to buy. Others criticized the Lustron Corporation for hiring government officials who\\u2019d helped them secure loans.\\nThe Hustle\\nStrandlund maintained that Lustrons were popular \\u2014 the company said some markets had waiting lists \\u2014 but needed more time to perfect the production and distribution processes.\\nIn the end, it didn\\u2019t matter. For the idea to get off the ground, the Lustron Corporation needed the government\\u2019s support, and it lost it. The RFC foreclosed on its loans in 1950. The Lustron Corporation was finished.\\nStrandlund didn\\u2019t recover from the failure. When he died in 1974, his widow, Clara, blamed his death on \\u201ca broken heart.\\u201d\\n\\u201cIt was his dream,\\u201d she told\\nThe Minneapolis Star Tribune\\n, \\u201cthat every Joe could have a house.\\u201d\\nThe case for modular homes\\nFor a few decades after Lustron ceased production, America didn\\u2019t really need them. The country got the postwar housing it desired, with developers\\nbuilding 13m homes from 1948 to 1958\\n(albeit almost entirely in suburbs blocked off to Black residents; shortages of quality housing persisted in many urban areas).\\nBut the US never developed two qualities fundamental to the Lustron: the idea that houses should be consumed like cars and the ability to mass-produce modular housing.\\nAmericans\\ngot hooked\\non treating houses as investments. In addition to a place to live, Americans expect a sizable return on their home, incentivizing homeowners and lawmakers to favor policies that constrain supply and restrict land use.\\nAccording\\nto a report by the Center for American Progress\\n, ~1%-2% of home construction in 2022 was modular. Off-site construction was about 10% in Germany, 15% in Japan, and 45% in many Scandinavian countries.\\nThe Hustle\\nMichela Zonta\\n, the report\\u2019s author and a housing policy analyst, believes modular housing could be an answer to America\\u2019s affordability crisis and housing shortage, which stands at\\n~4m units\\n. Modular construction is faster than on-site construction and brings down labor and material costs, two of the biggest obstacles to ramping up housing supply.\\nBut modular housing still faces many of the same roadblocks the Lustron did: inconsistent zoning policies and building codes across regions, along with funding gaps that make it difficult for modular developers to produce at scale.\\nMore than anything, Americans tend to lump modular housing with manufactured homes and trailer homes.\\n\\u201cModular homes are really indistinguishable from on-site constructed buildings,\\u201d Zonta says. \\u201cThey can be of very good quality.\\u201d\\nA renovated Lustron in Minneapolis. (Judy Griesedieck/Star Tribune via Getty Images)\\nThe Lustron, for all its failings, certainly proved its durability. Of the ~2.5k built,\\n~1.8k\\nare still standing, according to\\nJean Fetters-Conner\\n, who catalogs Lustrons at\\nLustron Research\\n.\\nMany of the original owners stayed in their Lustron for decades, opting for upgrades here and there. Fetters-Conner has heard \\u201cstories of [Lustrons] surviving tornadoes that wiped out entire blocks.\\u201d\\nIronically, Lustrons face more danger from the realities of the modern housing market. When they go on sale, they often attract interest from buyers who\\u2019d rather just have the land underneath.\\nThey raze the Lustron to make space for something new \\u2014 something larger and more expensive.\\nTopics:\\nHousing And Real Estate\\nFollow us on social media\\nRelated Articles\\nprevious\\nnext\\nThe Manhattan high-rise that shrunk itself down\\nAug 16, 2023\\nHow America\\u2019s top real estate agent sells 16 homes every day\\nJul 21, 2023\\nThe developers who see dollar signs in abandoned downtowns\\nJul 21, 2023\\nGet Smarter on Business and Tech\\nThanks for subscribing!\\nClose\\nGet the\\n5-minute newsletter\\nkeeping 2M+ innovators in the loop.\\nWant even more business resources?

More than 30 Million of lines of code more. I won't talk about complexity here, but this project can really say it's \\\"batteries included\\\".

Blobs, firmware, more graphics stuff, observability, wifi, storage, a whole word in itself and everything comes up in microseconds.\\nThere is such initram thingy, which is another \\\"mini\\\" (not mini in lines of code) operative system. Busybox? xD look at that.\\nNow, here it comes... the low-tech king: systemd! our love-hated init system (only init? well you already know).\\nNow, here we can start the operative system (which may not bee too simple), we could be talking for years, of each of the micro-components that help to launch the base OS services until you get to the login page.\\nDepending on the distro... we're skipping a hell of complexity (it's not the same the ps aux of an ubuntu desktop, than the ps aux of a minimal system). Let's skip it, let's skip hundreds of software components and phone home stuff.\\nThe auth part, gives for a few years more of reading code, talk about, skipping plugins and optional stuff.\\nThen you can get a window manager or a desktop environment (so a week or some months of code more), running over Xorg (do you think it's simple?) or Wayland (you can devote your life until you own this part).\\nAnd now... let's launch a \\\"web browser\\\".

And lack of knowledge and nostalgia glasses sometimes make people unaware of how complex things\\nused\\nto be.\\nA lot of underappreciated thing with boot firmware these days is that what is presented to you as end user is absolutely not connected to what options are actually possible. Also tons of complex and quirky code just to get the CPU and memory to the point of running other code. IIRC there's bits of code spanning early CPU reset\\nand\\nintel IME that are necessary to prevent the CPU from destroying itself, at least on some models. Similarly on AMD PSP.\\nSome of them will be disabled because the hw physically doesn't support them, or can result in weird behaviour that isn't going to be something you like, or effectively brick things.\\nAnother part is that it allows real proper modularity of an open platform, at least on the vendor side. Add a new device that requires special driver? No longer you have to spend a long time just to integrate a blob, there's a standard API/ABI whether the driver is closed or open source. ACPI provides tons of ways to just specify the details of where something is and how to connect it. I love a lot about openpower, but PetitBoot is effectively less open if only because there's no possibility to use add-in card requiring drivers that wasn't already compiled into flash. With UEFI it works.\\nUEFI is honestly in many ways less complex than previous systems (no more hooking into tape drive boot sequence), especially since there's much less that\\nneeds\\nto be in SMM block except for things required by hw (an example: some CPUs required SMM code for changing\\ncertain\\npower levels, because the OS level API doesn't expose the low-level details like enforcing a synchronization point on all CPUs or low level internal registers).\\nIf you use UEFI, you also don't need to implement whole complex (and IBM PC\\nincompatible\\n) craziness that is GRUB (or NTLDR with its ARC firmware emulation, or non-UEFI WINLDR which emulates chunk of UEFI...) - n.b. the last linux bootloader that properly handled IBM PC compatibility was LILO if installed in appropriate way (read: not how distros did it).\\nTPM and Secure Boot are reasonably easy parts of the whole thing. NFC and smartcards are also things that are reasonable for single engineer to grasp.\\nThere's less visible, though some people remember about it, complexity that is enforced on us by corporate interests - big part of why AMD PSP is closed source is the same reason AMD was unable to open source some of the HDMI code recently - both AMD PSP and Intel IME are part of implementing \\\"Secure Media Path\\\", aka DRM bullshit for MPAA (HDCP and its DisplayPort equivalent). It's also why various DRM systems don't fully support fully open systems (for example normal linux distros, not ones that are built by vendor of a device with special blobs)\\nNow, systemd I'll agree it takes a good idea but does with horrible implementation, and that's from someone who gave in and tries to use it fully (mainly because I have no time to implement an alternative).\\nWayland also makes in many ways life more complex than X11, OTOH XFree86 legacy of being lowest common denominator implementation even after reverting to X.Org means that people felt stuck.\\nreply\\nSamWhited\\n2 hours ago\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nLooks like it's a sunny day at the moment, but check out the website after it's been overcast for a day or two.

And it was easier to understand than the shell based solution.\\nBut it would have been easier to write and read in just about any other language.\\nPerl 4 at the time only had very primitive data structures. Most of the time you were concatenating and splitting strings together to mimic real data types. The baroque way file handles were a first class data structure made abstracting over them painful and hacky.\\nThat $foo and @foo and %foo were different variables caused innumerable bugs.\\nThe exposure of function arguments as a stack directly in the language made for weirdness all its own.\\nThe mimicry of shell expressions brought its own pain.\\nAnd finally, Perl\\u2019s greatest strength and horrific weakness: the regular expressions.

Generally, you won't be mixing Class::Accessor and Mo* based dependencies unless you are dealing with a shitty, barely maintained legacy codebase.\\nThere was a progression to things, mostly because of performance reasons why there is a bit of a proliferation. Moose (and the underlying Class::MOP) were about providing a meta-object protocol for Perl which didn't exist before it. As such, it was focused on being correct over fast. A whole community sprang up from stevan's art. Then sartak's Mouse came along and made some performance improvements with some compatibility caveats. Finally, mst's Moo stripped away the \\\"reflection\\\" aspects of Moose to really squeak out even more performance.\\nMooseX::Declare was always a (beautiful) research project. I spent some time in that space welding POE and MooseX::Declare together. But these weren't suitable for any kind of production code. If you see this live somewhere, you should definitely rip it out lol.\\nAs for TIMTOWTDI, this is sorta why project Andy Lester's Phalanx came about (it was trying to bless a chunk of modules as a sort of smoke test for Ponie (perl5 implementation on the Parrot VM (which was the first step toward a Perl 6, now Raku)). It was trying to provide an opinionated set of high quality libs for SWE.\\nUnfortunately, working in Perl really requires a bunch of skill and discipline if you want a long-term maintainable project.

To my surprise/delight, I discovered that the Solaris boxes we were using came with Perl pre-installed (which in hindsight is totally expected). So I decided to learn about it the proper way and the Llama book was exactly what I needed.\\nPeople have called Perl code line noise. But when I read the book for the first time, everything make sense to me because my mind likes mnemonics. $ is for ($)calar, @ is @(rray), % has a pair of circles like key/value pair and so on. I didn't find it odd that you'll get the array in list context and count in scalar context - it made complete sense. Till date, Perl is the language which I reach out for short-term tasks which need to be done immediately, because it helps me get the job done at the speed of thought.\\nI picked up some bash scripts as candidates to be re-written in Perl and I will never forget my mind being blown by the sheer lightening speed of Perl scripts; stuff that took many seconds or even minutes in bash were done in a second or less, even with my unrefined code. It was like a new world opened up and indeed, I felt like a wizard.\\nreply\\n7thaccount\\n1 hour ago\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nI love the glyphs in APL, but not so much with Perl as they don't seem consistent. Like there is an \\\"of that's an array, but you're accessing it with scalar context\\\" or some catch.\\nWith Python, you have lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Those are data structure objects that are useful for different things. Tuples use (), lists use [], and dictionaries use {}. After you learn that, you just learn the few methods and manners to populate them and you're done.\\nThere's nothing wrong with either way of course. Both appeal to different kinds of folks.\\nreply\\nmartyvis\\n3 hours ago\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nI was interested to learn on a recent episode of FLOSS Weekly [1] that Randal Schwartz had moved on from Perl somewhat and is now effectively an MVP and trainer of Dart and Flutter.\\n[1]\\nhttps://hackaday.com/2024/01/09/floss-weekly-episode-765-tha...\\nreply\\nokwhateverdude\\n35 minutes ago\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nSchwartz basically rode his early fame into the ground.

Maybe APMs? Either way, a lot of diagnostics like that came into vogue after Perl\\u2019s decline so this isn\\u2019t really the fault of the language but more just 3rd party tool writers putting their focus elsewhere.\\nThat all said, don\\u2019t be fooled into thinking such tooling doesn\\u2019t exist for Perl.\\n> safety\\nPerl basically invented unit tests amongst the scripting languages.

Perl is one of those languages people love to hate but is, in my opinion, one of the most misunderstood.\\n[edit] I should have added a comment about Perl\\u2019s backwards compatibility. Few other languages even come close to the longevity of Perl 5. And that commitment extends down throughout Perl\\u2019s ecosystem. With JavaScript I\\u2019m constantly scared the next npm update will break the project.\\nreply\\nsingingfish\\n5 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nBack compat is an important thing.  A few years ago we took a 250kline from perl 5.8.9 to perl 5.16 in one hit.  Out of the entire application under 50 lines of application code needed to be changed (excepting the big bump in cpan module versions).  Currently I'm slowly finalising the move from  5.16 to whatever debian stable is currently shipping 5.34 maybe?  The biggest pain point is some type safety in the  elastic search cpan module.  Other than that I've had to slightly refactor some hacky but effective cache invalidation startup code due to a weird `perl -e` bug I found but can't characterise sufficiently precisely to report.  The only reason that the perl latest upgrade wasn't done incrementally was because of a super weird unicode bug between perl and the oracle client library which is now out of scope for us.\\nBut I agree perl can have bad management problems because of different people's capabilities, and different people's approach to showing their individuality.\\nreply\\nlloeki\\n5 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\n> safety\\nYou forgot safe mode and tainting, which while imperfect and has some sharp edges, is a first class construct that when correctly wielded outright prevents classes of attacks like shell or SQL injections or XSS.\\nSome have been reinventing it in a piggybacked way, and so, partially/poorly (comparatively), e.g Rails's safe/unsafe strings in ActionView.\\nreply\\nalfiedotwtf\\n5 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\n>> safety\\n>\\n>Perl basically invented unit tests amongst the scripting languages. It also has stricter run modes to differentiate between one time scripts and important business code.\\nDon't forget Tainted Mode! It's 2024 and I still have never seen it adopted in any other language. It's essentially SELinux-lite for variables :)\\nIMHO Perl lost to Python because of 3 reasons: 1) Google at the time chose Python and it was the new cool startup everyone wanted to work at, 2) Pandas and Numpy weren't matched in the market (I'd even argue this is still true in 2024), and 3) Perl 6 was way too ambitious and scared people off (even though Perl 5 was never going to go away overnight (and still hasn't))\\nreply\\nalfiedotwtf\\n7 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nCowboy Coding is not a language thing, it\\u2019s a mentality thing.

You really can go from idea to functioning system as fast as you type without a lot of pre-planning. It's hard to describe, and the style has fallen out of fashion for more formal, easier to share between humans languages like Java or python, which feel like they introduce an inherent friction in that transition layer as a tradeoff for scalable teams and readability.\\nI miss it, but understand why it fell out of favor.

Even though I've now spent years in other languages compared to Perl, it's still stop-start in every other language.\\nI've said it many times, but Perl really moulds to your brain rather than the other way around.

However the languages are optimised for a slightly different purpose.  Python helps you to think more like the computer does, whereas perl helps the computer to think more like you do.\\nreply\\n__s\\n47 minutes ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nThis can be nice in Python. The `dis` module makes execution pretty transparent, & it's easy enough to know what bytecode a given line will compile to (granted, comprehensions creating closures does make that a bit harder)\\nCPython's implementation is also straightforward enough that you can look up ceval.c to get a gist of what an opcode is doing\\nreply\\ngonzus\\n6 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nI associate this with what we used to call \\\"one-liner programming\\\": I would write a single line of Perl code (in bash, prefixed with `perl -Mwarnings -MDebug -E'<code here>'`, convince myself the code did what we needed, and then share it around as a paste in irc / chat / whatever. It was amazing what you could achieve with the right modules, and Perl's flexibility allowed your mind to roam freely.\\nIncidentally, the fact that you cannot write this type of one-liner in any meaningful way with Python is one reason I do dislike that language.\\nreply\\nhnfong\\n2 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nIt's sad that Perl is dying a slow death.

Then, write it again in Python for scalable collaboration using the revised architecture.

But otherwise their recent license change and loss of technical founder have caused a bit of a shift in their user base towards open source forks. Which over time might substantially devalue their growth perspective. Any new projects would default to open source tools and not their proprietary thing.\\nThis is also what I see when consulting on Elasticsearch and Opensearch projects. Almost all my recent clients start out with Opensearch these days because it is the open source choice and they are (mostly) in AWS just a few short years after they announced their license change. I'm pretty sure that's going to happen with things like Terraform and Opentofu as well. Anyone considering making similar moves, there's a growing amount of cases where this ends with a fork.\\nSo, yes, this is why they are selling now. Before it turns into a fire sale. To a buyer it might be attractive to milk existing accounts for a while. A smart buyer might even reverse the license change in order to get some prospect of growth and re-absorb the community. But barring that, it's going to be the usual deal of either companies like Oracle or some hedge fund squeezing this thing dry until there's nothing left.\\nreply\\nSloopJon\\n45 minutes ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\n> a shift in their user base towards open source forks\\nI wonder how we can verify this.

But on 4 February 2022, I embarked on a journey that, at the time, seemed to stretch impossibly far into the future \\u2014 a future that wasn\\u2019t entirely known yet. In the\\nAPL Orchard\\nchat room on\\nStack Exchange\\n, a dozen APLers, some experts and some newbies, held the very first\\nAPL Quest\\nchat event.\\nIn this first session, we explored the oldest\\nAPL Problem Solving Competition\\nphase 1 problem \\u2013 question number 1 from 2013 \\u2013 presented our solutions, and discussed them for about half an hour. The following week, I recorded\\na video\\nwhere I went through some of these solutions, with\\nthe code posted on GitHub\\n. This pattern continued each week; chat events on Fridays, and a follow-up video released (usually) the week after, each session looking at a different phase 1 problem.\\nAPL Quest chat in progress\\nInspiration\\nOriginally,\\nthe idea came from Richard Savenije\\n, inspired by\\nLeetCode\\n. Both he and\\nStefan Kruger, who later became my colleague\\n, were frustrated with LeetCode\\u2019s assumptions about programming languages \\u2013 assumptions that didn\\u2019t really hold for APL. Aside from that, their test framework didn\\u2019t permit APL submissions anyway.\\nSo, Richard suggested that we should make our own problems website, and Stefan pointed out that\\nmy colleague Rich Park\\nhad already set up\\na website\\nthat offered automatic checking of solutions to simple problems. With the help of a summer intern, Rich had populated the site with all APL Problem Solving Competition phase 1 problems from 2013 until 2021 (the 2022 round was scheduled to launch two months later). Richard suggested using this site for weekly puzzles, one every Friday afternoon, and we found a time that suited the people present.\\nNext, we had to decide on a format. Should it be a Zoom meeting or a chat event? Earlier, there had been a couple of chat events series in the APL Orchard; the\\nAPL Cultivation\\nseries ran weekly from October 2017 until May 2018 and semi-weekly from 28 November 2019 until August 2020. Stefan Kruger was in the process of converting these to a since-completed book,\\nAPL Cultivations\\n. After some discussions, we decided to have the sessions in chat, and I came up with the idea of recording a short screen cast after each event.\\nI got the arithmetic wrong, and\\nclaimed we\\u2019d have 100 weeks worth of problems\\n, as the 2022 problems would be available by the time we had explored the other problems, giving us almost two years of material. Actually, the 2023 problems were ready when we got to them! But either way, the end seemed very far away\\u2026\\nTechnical Details\\nAnd yet, here we are, after 110 weeks, 110 live chat events, and 110 published videos \\u2013 a total of over 22 hours of video contents! We never missed a week, even on various holidays, though Rich Park did have to substitute for me a few times when I was prevented from hosting, and sometimes I had to push off recording and/or publishing a video until two or three weeks after the chat event. Sometimes, I\\u2019d host the chat event while travelling in a car or a train, and sometimes I\\u2019d record videos in hotel rooms or in other people\\u2019s homes. By always using a plain white (or off-white) background, I was able to get a consistent look, irrespective of where I was, though I sometimes had to move furniture to sit in front of a bare wall, and once I had to drape my bedspread over the hotel room\\u2019s television\\u2026\\nRecording an APL Quest session\\nSpeaking of looks, I\\u2019ve received praise for the technical quality of my videos; for their smooth integration of presentation and live coding and for their nice design. So, for those who are interested in how I did it\\u2026the introductory screen and the problem statement are simply PowerPoint slides with Fade transitions. After the problem description slide, I faded to a blank slide, and from there, I switched application to\\nRIDE\\n(on Microsoft Windows, you have to install it separately), which was running in full-screen mode with the Language Bar and Status Bar hidden. When I started, the newest released RIDE was version 4.3, but I was running pre-releases of v4.4 and Dyalog v18.2 that added the\\nNord theme\\nwhich I had fallen in love with in 2021. By matching my slide colours to the RIDE theme, I achieved a seamless transition without having to do any video editing.\\nI\\u2019m somewhat of a typeface enthusiast. Previously, I had searched for what I considered\\ngood sans-serif fonts\\n, and for this project, I choose\\nthe humanist Go font\\n. For APL code, I went with\\nmy own SAX2 font\\nwhich I had created by extracting letterforms from the old\\nSAX (\\nS\\nHARP\\nA\\nPL for UNI\\nX\\n)\\nmanual, and then extended to cover the characters necessary today. However, it bothered me that the SAX font looked so thin next to Go, due to being digitised from the golf ball of a\\nIBM Selectric\\nwithout accounting for the visual weight normally added by the typewriter\\u2019s ink ribbon.\\nI had to hack font selection into RIDE, which I was able to do because RIDE is built using normal web technology, in particular\\nCSS\\n. After some experimentation, I found\\nthe way to do it\\n. After I switched to RIDE v4.5, I was able to set the fontface in an official manner, but even this wasn\\u2019t enough. I had relied on PowerPoint\\u2019s reasonable auto-bolding of the SAX font, which otherwise didn\\u2019t include bold, but RIDE v4.5 wouldn\\u2019t let me style the APL font further, so I had to hack RIDE again!\\n\\u201cHacking\\u201d RIDE v4.5\\nThis time, I didn\\u2019t need to modify source files, but rather found that RIDE was \\u201cvulnerable\\u201d (though not in a dangerous way) to CSS injection through its font input field. Making the font bold didn\\u2019t look right, as that would only smear the letters horizontally, but adding a \\u201ctext stroke\\u201d had the desired effect. If you want your RIDE to resemble what you can see in the videos, set the APL font to\\nSAX2')}.monaco-editor *{-webkit-text-stroke:.67px currentcolor}\\n. With the visuals set, I recorded using\\nOBS Studio\\nand, on the rare occasion that I needed to edit something, I used\\nDaVinci Resolve\\n.\\nConcluding the Series\\nWhen we finished that last session,\\nit felt rather anti-climactic\\n, but I can look back on a very enjoyable time. And of course, the efforts that all participants put into this are not forgotten; we\\u2019ve got an amazing chat and video series that future APLers can enjoy. Thank you to everyone who contributed; chat participants, video commenters, colleagues (especially\\nBrian Becker\\nwho authored all the problems), and most of all my wife, who often had to encourage me to record the next video(s) and also gave me the time and space to do so, even if it meant single-handedly keeping our children quiet.

Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nGeneral\\n\\\\n\\nWhat is this project?\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nSatCat5 is a mixed-media Ethernet switch that lets a variety of devices communicate on the same network.\\\\nIt also includes embedded software libraries to help microcontrollers interact with Ethernet networks.\\n\\\\n\\nA SatCat5 switch is roughly equivalent to a typical consumer-grade Ethernet switch,\\\\nexcept that it can also deliver Ethernet frames over nontraditional media like I2C, SPI, or UART.\\n\\\\n\\nWhat is Ethernet over UART?\\n\\\\n\\nAn\\nEthernet frame\\nis just a series of bytes.\\\\nYou can send those bytes over any medium you like.\\\\nEthernet frames can include higher-layer protocols like UDP and TCP/IP, but they don't have to.\\n\\\\n\\nOn interfaces that don't already have frame-boundary indicators (like I2C, SPI, and UART),\\\\nSatCat5 uses\\nIETF RFC 1055\\n\\\\n\\nSLIP encoding\\n\\\\nas a simple way to mark the start and end of each frame.\\\\nThese interfaces don't require inter-packet gaps or preambles.\\n\\\\n\\nDon't you mean octets?\\n\\\\n\\nSure.\\n\\\\n\\nWhy should I use this?\\n\\\\n\\nMost low-power microcontrollers don't have traditional Ethernet ports,\\\\nand it's not something that can be implemented with software-controlled GPIO.\\\\nSatCat5 lets a microcontroller communicate on the same Local Area Network as a bunch of PCs,\\\\na GPU system-on-module, or an FPGA.\\n\\\\n\\nWe think this might be useful for Internet-of-Things applications,\\\\nbut even more useful for things like small satellites and cubesats,\\\\nwhich typically pack many microcontroller-based subsystems into a small volume.\\n\\\\n\\nSatCat5 is used for the modular payload interface on\\nthe Slingshot-1 cubesat mission\\n.\\\\nFor more details, please refer to the\\nfull interface specification and mission-operations report\\n.\\n\\\\n\\nCan I customize it?\\n\\\\n\\nYes! That's a big part of why we chose the CERN Open Hardware License,\\\\nso you can use our VHDL building blocks to link together a custom SatCat5 switch for your application.\\\\nWe anticipate most users will need some degree of tailoring, so we've tried to make it as easy as we can.\\n\\\\n\\nWe have chosen the \\\\\\\"weakly reciprocal\\\\\\\" variant of the OHL (CERN-OHL-W v2 or later).\\\\nIf you make improvements to SatCat5, you may be obligated to share them.\\\\nPlease refer to the\\nfull text of the license\\nfor details.\\n\\\\n\\nWhy CERN-OHL-W?\\n\\\\n\\nEarlier versions of SatCat5 were released under an\\nLGPLv3 license\\n.\\\\nYou may continue to use those versions under those terms.\\n\\\\n\\nHowever, some users found it difficult to use LGPLv3 because its\\\\nlegal terms are ambiguous or difficult to apply to FPGA designs.\\\\nSuch concerns are\\nechoed by OSHWA\\n,\\\\nwhich now recommends CERN-OHL licenses for open hardware and gateware.\\n\\\\n\\nMoving forward, we chose\\nCERN-OHL-W v2 or later\\n\\\\nfor the same reason we chose LGPL. They are very similar in strategic intent.\\n\\\\n\\nCan I help?\\n\\\\n\\nYes! We welcome outside contributions including bug reports and code changes.\\\\nPlease check\\nthe guide here\\nfor more information.\\n\\\\n\\nWhat about power consumption?\\n\\\\n\\nMost Ethernet switches require several watts to operate.\\\\nSatCat5 uses a small fraction of that.\\n\\\\n\\nAn I2C/SPI/UART network switch can be run for less than 100 mW.\\n\\\\n\\nEven a multi-port gigabit network switch can be run for less than 700 mW in MAC-to-MAC mode.\\n\\\\n\\nWhat is MAC-to-MAC mode?\\n\\\\n\\nThe biggest power hog in a regular Ethernet network isn't the switch logic; it's the transceivers.\\\\nYou need one on each end of every 1000BASE-T link, together they draw about 1W per port.\\\\nThey need that power to cross building-scale distances up to 100m, but not everyone needs that.\\n\\\\n\\nInstead, we can leverage the various\\\\n\\nMedia-Independent Interfaces\\n\\\\nthat have become de-facto standards.\\\\nThese are typically used to allow a device (the MAC) to communicate with\\\\na specialized physical-layer transceiver (the PHY).\\n\\\\n\\nIn most networks, each end of a link has a MAC and a PHY, with a long cable in between:\\n\\\\n\\nMAC - PHY - ...long cable... - PHY - MAC\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nBut most MAC-to-PHY links are roughly symmetric; in most cases you can attach them back-to-back:\\n\\\\n\\nMAC - ...short cable... - MAC\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nThe MAC-to-MAC signals aren't suitable to travel long distances, but that's not a problem for a 30cm long cubesat.\\n\\\\n\\nWhat if I want regular Ethernet ports?\\n\\\\n\\nSatCat5 supports that too.\\\\nJust attach a suitable PHY chip, and signal transformers if needed.\\\\nTake a look at the\\nexample design\\n.\\n\\\\n\\nWe include an\\nMDIO interface\\n\\\\nif the PHY needs configuration.  We also include I2C, SPI, and UART interfaces.\\\\nThese configuration interfaces are operated using\\nConfigBus\\n,\\\\ncommands from ROM or an attached microcontroller.\\\\n\\nMulti-platform C++ software drivers\\nare provided for each I/O interface.\\n\\\\n\\nFPGAs\\n\\\\n\\nWhat FPGAs are supported?\\n\\\\n\\nCurrently we support several FPGA platforms:\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nLattice iCE40\\n\\\\n\\nMicrosemi PolarFire\\n\\\\n\\nXilinx 7-series FPGAs (Artix7, Kintex7, Virtex7, Zynq-7000)\\n\\\\n\\nXilinx Ultrascale and Ultrascale+ FPGAs\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nWe hope to add support for other FPGA platforms\\nsoon\\n.\\n\\\\n\\nHow big an FPGA do I need?\\n\\\\n\\nResource needs scale more-or-less linearly with the number of ports.\\\\nThe limiting resource is usually block-RAM.\\\\nLow-speed ports don't need as much block-RAM as gigabit ports.\\n\\\\n\\nThe full-size example design (four gigabit ports and four low-speed ports)\\\\ncould fit on an XC7A50T with room to spare.\\\\nThe minimalist design with only low-speed ports could easily fit on an XC7A15T.\\n\\\\n\\nHow do I build the example designs?\\n\\\\n\\nA variety of example designs\\nare provided here\\n.\\n\\\\n\\nEach sub-folder includes a TCL script that will create any required project files\\\\nand automatically execute the build using Libero, Vivado, or Yosys.\\\\nYou must have the appropriate vendor tool installed or provide a suitable\\nDocker image\\n.\\n\\\\n\\nMost of these scripts are linked to \\\\\\\"make\\\\\\\" targets specified in the SatCat5 root folder.\\n\\\\n\\nScripts for Xilinx Vivado have been tested with Vivado 2015.4, 2016.3, and 2019.1, but they should work as-is with most other versions.\\\\nScripts that use Xilinx SDK, such as \\\\\\\"arty_managed\\\\\\\", require version 2016.3 or above.\\n\\\\n\\nAs an example, consider the\\nbasic example Digilient Arty A7\\n.\\n\\\\n\\nIf you're running Linux, just run \\\\\\\"make arty_35t\\\\\\\" in the root folder.\\n\\\\n\\nIf not, launch Vivado and run the following commands:\\n\\\\n\\ncd \\\\\\\\[your SatCat5 download folder\\\\\\\\]\\\\nset argv 35t\\\\nsource examples/arty_a7/create_project_arty_a7.tcl\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nWhat about automated build environments?\\n\\\\n\\nInternally, we use Jenkins to perform automated builds and unit-tests for every new version.\\\\nThis allows a rapid\\nContinuous Integration / Continuous Deployment build cycle\\n.\\n\\\\n\\nThe provided Jenkins script will not function outside our company LAN,\\\\nbut can serve as a template for your own automated build systems.\\n\\\\n\\nNetwork Features\\n\\\\n\\nWhat is the switch topology?\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nThe switch_core logic is a shared-medium, output queued switch.\\\\nThis architecture was chosen mainly for simplicity;\\\\nit is well-suited to smaller networks with many low-rate ports and up to a dozen gigabit ports.\\\\nBeyond that scale, a more complex crossbar or shared-memory topology is typically required.\\n\\\\n\\nWhat switch features are supported?\\n\\\\n\\nThe core of SatCat5 is a Layer-2 Ethernet switch.\\\\nThe switch can be built in managed or unmanaged configurations.\\\\nManaged switches are configured using the\\nConfigBus interface\\n.\\n\\\\n\\nThe switch directs packets based on destination MAC address.\\\\nThe MAC-address(es) associated with each port are learned automatically\\\\nby inspecting the source MAC address of each frame.\\\\nPackets with an unrecognized destination are treated as broadcast packets.\\n\\\\n\\nThe switch supports broadcast packets (destination MAC FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)\\\\nand will send such packets to every port except the original ingress port.\\n\\\\n\\nInternet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)\\n\\\\nhas rudimentary support.\\\\nThe switch does not track group membership on an address-by-address basis,\\\\nbut will limit multicast traffic to ports that are IGMP-aware.\\n\\\\n\\nVirtual local-area networks (VLAN / IEEE 802.1Q)\\n\\\\nare supported for network segmentation and prioritization.\\\\nPer-VID throughput allocation may be added in a future release.\\n\\\\n\\nPrecision time protocol (PTP / IEEE 1588-2008)\\n\\\\nis supported.  If enabled, a SatCat5 switch acts as an \\\\\\\"End-to-end Transparent Clock\\\\\\\"\\\\nas described in IEEE 1588-2019 Section 10.2a.  A software-based PTP client is also\\\\nprovided.  SatCat5 uses VERDACT technology to allow sub-nanosecond accuracy.\\n\\\\n\\nSpanning Tree Protocol\\n\\\\nis not supported. It is up to the user to ensure no loops are present in the network.\\n\\\\n\\nSimple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)\\n\\\\nis not supported. We may add a simpler management protocol in a future release.\\\\n(e.g., So that a network device can activate or deactivate certain high-speed ports to save power.)\\n\\\\n\\nTime-Triggered Ethernet\\nis not currently supported.\\n\\\\n\\nCut-through switching\\n\\\\nfor latency reduction is not supported.\\\\nDue to extreme disparities in line-rates, this would be difficult to integrate.\\n\\\\n\\nPacket prioritization is optionally supported.\\\\nPackets can receive elevated priority based on EtherType and/or VLAN priority tags.\\n\\\\n\\nMany of these features are optional and can be disabled to save FPGA resources.\\n\\\\n\\nHow are MAC addresses assigned to network devices?\\n\\\\n\\nFor now, we're leaving that up to each developer.\\\\nFunctionally, the most important requirement is to ensure that each address on the local network is unique.\\\\nFor typical applications, there is no need to register for an OUI;\\\\nrandomly assigned addresses from the Locally Administered Address pool have an\\\\ninfinitesimal chance of accidental collision.\\n\\\\n\\nA simple method is to take\\nsix random bytes\\n\\\\nand set the\\nU/L bit\\nto one.\\\\nIf there will never be more than one instance of a given device type on a network,\\\\nthen that random address can simply be hard-coded.\\n\\\\n\\nHow are each device's MAC addresses associated with specific ports?\\n\\\\n\\nBy default, the switch is self-learning:\\\\nit monitors source and destination MAC addresses to determine where to send future packets.\\\\nTo save FPGA resources, MAC tables are typically limited to a fixed maximum number\\\\nof addresses for the entire network (typically ~64 unique addresses).\\n\\\\n\\nHow big can the network be?\\n\\\\n\\nThe MAC-learning and MAC-lookup system is resource-intensive.\\\\nThe example designs are limited to a maximum network size of 64 devices.\\\\nThis can be increased at the cost of additional FPGA resources.\\n\\\\n\\nWhy is the example design segmented into two parts?\\n\\\\n\\nEach instance of the \\\\\\\"switch_core\\\\\\\" block is a network segment, with different rules and settings.\\n\\\\n\\nThe low-speed segment services all I2C, SPI, and UART ports.\\\\nIt is always powered on and ready to receive frames.\\\\nIt has an 8-bit datapath and relatively small buffer sizes.\\\\nThis segment allows runt frames (see below).\\n\\\\n\\nThe high-speed segment services all gigabit Ethernet ports.\\\\nIt can be shut down to save power.\\\\nIt has a 24-bit datapath and larger buffer sizes, to better accommodate bursty traffic.\\\\nSince any port could be another gigabit Ethernet switch,\\\\nit has a full MAC-lookup engine so that any port can have any number of MAC addresses (up to a preset total).\\\\nWe've tested designs with datapaths up to 48-bits wide.\\n\\\\n\\nThe port_crosslink block bridges the two, performing any required conversions.\\\\nDatapath widths in all cases are set such that the individual port is the only relevant throughput limit.\\n\\\\n\\nWhat frame sizes are accepted?\\n\\\\n\\nAll network segments support normal frames (i.e., 64-1522 bytes).\\n\\\\n\\nIf configured, any segment can also accept jumbo frames (up to 9022 bytes).\\\\nUsing jumbo frames increases the required buffer sizes (see discussion below).\\n\\\\n\\nIf configured, low-speed segment(s) can also accept runt frames (as few as 18 bytes).\\\\nIn some cases, this can save a lot of wasted time on UART ports.\\n\\\\n\\nWhat happens if network segments have different capabilities?\\n\\\\n\\nAs they cross to a segment with different rules,\\\\nrunt frames have their payload zero-padded to the new minimum length.\\\\nTo support this change, the EtherType field must not be used as a length parameter.\\\\nThe new FCS will automatically be recalculated.\\n\\\\n\\nJumbo frames are simply dropped if they cross to a segment that doesn't support them.\\\\nThis is usually the desired behavior,\\\\nsince jumbo traffic usually isn't intended or well-suited for low-speed network nodes.\\n\\\\n\\nWhat happened to all the old MAC-address lookup algorithms?\\n\\\\n\\nPrevious versions of SatCat5 included a variety of algorithms for looking up ports based on MAC-address.\\\\nHowever, in practice the LUTRAM implementation matched or outperformed all others in terms of complexity,\\\\nnetwork scalability, resource utilization, thoughput, and latency.\\\\nThe new general-purpose TCAM block is based on this algorithm, and supports improved caching.\\n\\\\n\\nRather than upgrading every implementation to support higher throughput,\\\\nwe opted to focus our efforts on one algorithm only.\\n\\\\n\\nHow do I choose the switch_core datapath width?\\n\\\\n\\nTo avoid bottlenecks, the datapath of a given network segment should\\\\nbe wide enough to accept the sum of worst-case traffic for all ports\\\\non that segment, not including internal crosslinks.\\n\\\\n\\nFor example, the low-speed segment in the example design has four ports,\\\\neach running at a maximum of 10 Mbps, for a total of 40 Mbps.\\\\nIts datapath is 8-bits wide running at 25 MHz, for a total of 200 Mbps.\\\\nSince 40 << 200, this is adequate, and the extra margin allows smaller\\\\nbuffer sizes (see below).\\n\\\\n\\nFor example, the high-speed segment in the example design has four ports,\\\\neach running at a maximum of 1000 Mbps, for a total of 4000 Mbps.\\\\nIts datapath is 24-bits wide running at 200 MHz, for a total of 4800 Mbps.\\\\nSince 4000 < 4800, this is adequate.\\\\nHowever, the reduced margin means that a larger input buffer is required.\\n\\\\n\\nHow do I choose input buffer sizes?\\n\\\\n\\nInput queues are small, they are used only for clock-domain-crossing and packet verification.\\n\\\\n\\nThe absolute minimum input buffer size is 2 kiB,\\\\nenough for a full-size frame, plus the start of the next one.\\\\nThis is adequate in any case where the switch_core datapath\\\\nis several times faster than the aggregate throughput,\\\\nwhich is generally true of segments with mostly low-speed ports.\\n\\\\n\\nMore congested network segments should increase this limit to allow at least two full-size frames.\\\\nIn other words: 4 kiB for normal frames or 20 kiB for jumbo frames.\\\\nThis allows full throughput in cases where many ports simultaneously receive consecutive maximum-length frames.\\\\nThere is no benefit to input buffers that are substantially larger than this threshold.\\n\\\\n\\nBecause this switch is primarily output-queued, input buffer overflows should almost never occur.\\\\nFrequent input overflows likely indicate an inadequate switch_core datapath width (see previous question).\\n\\\\n\\nHow do I choose output buffer sizes?\\n\\\\n\\nSince this switch is output-queued, dropping frames at the output queue\\\\nis a necessary and unavoidable means of flow control.\\\\nIn cases with constant and regular traffic,\\\\nframe drops at the output buffer indicate that no solution exists;\\\\nthere's simply too much traffic going to a given egress port,\\\\nso some frame loss was inevitable.\\n\\\\n\\nHowever, a larger buffer can help in cases where traffic is bursty.\\\\nThe buffer must be sized to accommodate the largest expected burst,\\\\nbut unfortunately such statistics are highly application-specific.\\n\\\\n\\nIn practice, we have found that an output buffer about 4x larger than the input buffer is usually adequate.\\\\nIn any case, the output buffer should never be smaller than the input buffer.\\n\\\\n\\nHow are errors reported?\\n\\\\n\\nMost errors are handled in switch_core.\\\\nThey are reported by a \\\\\\\"toggle\\\\\\\" event on the errvec_t signal;\\\\na change in a given bit represents a specific error type.\\\\n(See switch_core.vhd for details.)\\\\nThe toggle events are used to facilitate clock-domain crossing,\\\\nsince most designs use multiple network segments with different clock domains.\\n\\\\n\\nThe error_reporting block can report this in different ways.\\\\nIt produces a human-readable ASCII stream which can be forwarded to a UART or an LCD screen.\\\\nYou can also just blink an LED for each error. (The example design does all three!)\\\\nSee switch_aux for examples.\\n\\\\n\\nCertain types of errors (e.g., PHY-reported errors or undecodable SGMII 8b/10b symbols)\\\\nwill report the error (as above) and then reset the xMII interface to recover to a known-good state.\\n\\\\n\\nWhy is my SGMII link getting so many errors?\\n\\\\n\\nThe SGMII link requires low-jitter, stable reference clocks.\\\\nWe've found that the clocks provided on the AC701 development board are not adequate for this purpose.\\\\nOn our prototype, we've found that providing a high-quality external clock to\\\\nthe FPGA and/or the AR8031 PHY massively reduces the error rate.\\\\nReference clocks of 100 MHz or higher also help to reduce PLL clock-jitter.\\n\\\\n\\nThis is a topic for future development, and we hope to make improvements to improve reference jitter tolerance.\\n\\\\n\\nPi-Wire\\n\\\\n\\nWhat is \\\\\\\"Pi-Wire\\\\\\\"?\\n\\\\n\\nPi-Wire is software that can be loaded onto a Raspberry Pi.\\\\nIt converts the Pi's conventional Ethernet port to the 4-wire format used by SatCat5.\\\\nThis allows a low-cost adapter to connect a conventional Ethernet network to a SatCat5 switch or a SatCat5 device.\\n\\\\n\\nThe name is intended to indicate that the device acts as close as possible to a wire.\\\\nIdeally, it simply allows every packet through, verbatim,\\\\nand doesn't really act like an independent device.\\n\\\\n\\nRefer to the\\nPi-Wire README\\nfor additional information.\\n\\\\n\\nWhat interfaces are supported?\\n\\\\n\\nThe Pi-Wire can be used in 4-wire UART mode or in SPI mode.\\n\\\\n\\nIn 4-wire UART mode,\\\\nthe flow-control signals are ignored and the Pi-Wire software is always ready to accept new data.\\\\nAs a result, the interface is completely symmetric,\\\\nwhich means that the Pi-Wire can be connected to a SatCat5 switch or to a SatCat5 device.\\n\\\\n\\nIn SPI mode, the Raspberry Pi must act as an SPI clock source.\\\\nAs a result, it can only connect to a SatCat5 switch.\\n\\\\n\\nPrecision Time Protocol (PTP)\\n\\\\n\\nWhat is the Precision Time Protocol?\\n\\\\n\\nThe Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is defined by IEEE-1588.\\\\nIt is a network protocol for precise two-way time transfer and ranging,\\\\nallowing PTP clients to precisely synchronize their clocks over a network.\\\\nPTP can operate in L2 (raw-Ethernet) or L3 (UDP) mode.\\n\\\\n\\nPTP clients apply precise Tx and Rx timestamps to each packet.\\\\nThe catch is that end-to-end network delays are affected by network congestion.\\\\nFor this reason, network equipment between PTP clients must update certain\\\\ntimestamp fields in PTP messages, to allow clients to accurately compensate.\\n\\\\n\\nHow does SatCat5 support PTP?\\n\\\\n\\nSatCat5 is intended to comply with IEEE-1588-2019.\\\\nAll PTP features are optional.\\n\\\\n\\nSatCat5 switches operate in \\\\\\\"end-to-end transparent clock\\\\\\\" mode\\\\nas described in IEEE 1588-2019 Section 10.2a.\\\\nThe switch supports both L2 and L3 modes without further configuration.\\n\\\\n\\nThe\\nport_mailmap\\nblock is a fully capable PTP endpoint.\\\\nIt can apply all required transmit and receive timestamps,\\\\noperating in one-step mode (each SYNC message includes its own timestamp)\\\\nor in two-step mode (timestamp sent in a separate FOLLOW_UP message).\\\\nIt also includes a PTP-compatible real-time clock controlled by the\\\\n\\nptp::Client\\nand\\nptp::TrackingController\\nclasses.\\n\\\\n\\nAll of the above use VERDACT to allow accurate collinear timestamps\\\\nregardless of the source and destination clock domain(s).\\n\\\\n\\nFor more information, refer to the\\nvc707_ptp_client\\nexample design.\\n\\\\n\\nWhat is VERDACT?\\n\\\\n\\nVernier-referenced digital asynchronous collinear timestamps (VERDACT).\\n\\\\n\\nOur paper in IEEE Access\\n\\\\ndescribes VERDACT theory of operation in detail, along with lab measurements of its\\\\nperformance. In many cases, VERDACT timestamps have sub-picosecond collinearity.\\n\\\\n\\nIn summary, VERDACT consists of a vernier reference (see\\nptp_counter_gen.vhd\\n)\\\\nand a synchronized counter (see `ptp_counter_sync.vhd').\\\\nOne reference can drive any number of asynchronous counters.\\\\nEach counter reports the estimated timestamp for each rising edge in a given clock domain.\\\\nAll such timestamps are collinear with the same best-fit line (i.e., numeric value vs. time).\\n\\\\n\\nVERDACT is related to the\\\\n\\nDDMTD\\n\\\\nsystem used by\\nWhite Rabbit Project\\n.\\\\nDDMTD allows FPGAs to measure the static phase offset between syntonized\\\\nclocks with sub-picosecond accuracy.\\n\\\\n\\nVERDACT allows FPGAs to measure dynamic time offsets between asynchronous clocks\\\\nwith sub-picosecond accuracy, eliminating the need for Synchronous Ethernet.\\n\\\\n\\nHow accurate is SatCat5 PTP?\\n\\\\n\\nVERDACT has demonstrated sub-picosecond timestamp collinearity.\\n\\\\n\\nThe end-to-end synchronization of the PTP client has demonstrated sub-nanosecond precision.\\n\\\\n\\nReference Design: Arty\\n\\\\n\\nWhat's the Arty reference design?\\n\\\\n\\nThe\\nArty A7\\n\\\\nis a low-cost FPGA development board made by Digilent.\\\\nIt includes an Artix-7 FPGA, a 10/100 Ethernet port, and a number of PMOD ports.\\n\\\\n\\nSatCat5 includes a reference design for an Ethernet switch.\\\\nWhen installed on the Arty A7, it becomes a five-port SatCat5 switch\\\\nwith one regular Ethernet port and four auto-sensing SPI/UART ports.\\n\\\\n\\nFurther details specific to this design are included\\nhere\\n.\\n\\\\n\\nReference Design: Prototype V1\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nWhat's the Prototype V1?\\n\\\\n\\nThe Prototype V1 is a reference design that can be built using an off the shelf FPGA board,\\\\nplus a custom PCB for I/O.\\\\nThe custom card uses an FMC connector (LPC or HPC),\\\\nso it should be compatible with a variety of FPGA development boards.\\\\nWe provide a reference design for the\\nXilinx AC701\\n.\\n\\\\n\\nThe custom board includes the following interfaces:\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nFour PMOD connectors, with 3.3V level shifters.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nAn\\nSJA1105\\n\\\\nautomotive switch ASIC.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nOne\\nTJA1100\\n\\\\nspecial-purpose automotive transceiver, connected to the automotive switch.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nTwo RJ45 jacks with, each with an\\\\n\\nAR8031 PHY\\n.\\\\nEach one has an RGMII and SGMII interface.\\\\nBoth SGMII interfaces are routed to the FMC port (i.e., controlled by the FPGA).\\\\nThe first RGMII is connected to the automotive switch ASIC; the other is routed to the FMC port.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nWhy include the automotive switch?\\n\\\\n\\nInitial design concepts used a two-tiered approach in an attempt to save power.\\\\nAn FPGA would handle the lower-speed (nontraditional) interfaces,\\\\nwith an uplink to the ASIC, which would handle gigabit traffic.\\n\\\\n\\nWe ultimately decided not to pursue this approach.\\\\nAs a result, the software that configures and boots the SJA1105 is currently incomplete and non-functional.\\n\\\\n\\nWhy are there so many Xilinx projects?\\n\\\\n\\nEach project is an example design showing different switch capabilities,\\\\nand has a separate corresponding top-level VHDL file under /src/vhdl/xilinx.\\\\nThey use progressively more FPGA resources.\\\\nDue to differences in FPGA usage and clock infrastructure, their power draw varies substantially.\\n\\\\n\\nThe \\\\\\\"_base\\\\\\\" design is the simplest.\\\\nIt includes several low-speed ports and an RMII uplink port that connects to the automotive switch ASIC.\\n\\\\n\\nThe \\\\\\\"_rgmii\\\\\\\" design is the first that supports gigabit Ethernet.\\\\nIt provides all of the above plus two RGMII ports,\\\\none to the automotive switch ASIC and one to the second AR8031 transceiver.\\n\\\\n\\nThe \\\\\\\"_sgmii\\\\\\\" design is the most capable.\\\\nIt provides all of the above plus an SGMII interface to each of the two AR8031 transceivers.\\n\\\\n\\nHow do I use the PMOD connectors?\\n\\\\n\\nBy default:\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nPMOD1-4 is an Ethernet-over-serial port that can auto-detect SPI or UART mode\\n\\\\n\\nPMOD5 is only used to configure the automotive switch\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nEach PMOD port has a DIP switch that is used to set level-shifter direction.\\\\nReferring to the photo below,\\\\nSPI ports (top) should be set with switch 1/2/3/4 = 0/0/1/0 (respectively).\\\\nUART ports (bottom) should be set with switch 1/2/3/4 = 0/1/0/1.\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nThe UART ports are compatible with common USB-UART devices from\\\\n\\nDigilent\\nand other vendors.\\n\\\\n\\nHow do I use the RJ45 connectors?\\n\\\\n\\nOn startup, these ports are inactive.\\\\nA separate\\nPython application\\n\\\\nis required to activate them and order the FPGA to configure the transceivers using a sequence of\\\\n\\nMDIO commands\\n.\\\\nThese configuration commands are loaded through a separate UART interface.\\n\\\\n\\nOnce configured, the RJ45 connectors are plug-and-play.\\\\nThe transceiver automatically establishes connections with most off-the-shelf Ethernet devices.\\\\n(Including other switches.)\\\\nAll xMII options now support 10/100/1000 auto-negotiation.\\n\\\\n\\nHow do I run the Chat-client demo application?\\n\\\\n\\n\\\\n\\nThe Python Chat-client demo is used to configure the transceivers (see above).\\\\nIt also acts as a demo that can send and receive raw Ethernet frames as a simple text \\\\\\\"chatroom\\\\\\\".\\\\nThe same application is used to control UART and gigabit Ethernet interfaces attached to the host PC.\\n\\\\n\\nTo run it, switch to the test/chat_client folder and run \\\\\\\"python chat_client.py\\\\\\\".\\\\nRefer to the\\nREADME\\nfor prerequisites and other details.\\n\\\\n\\nLegal\\n\\\\n\\nWhy do you require a Contributor License Agreement?\\n\\\\n\\nWithout some kind of contract, it is unlikely that\\\\nThe Aerospace Corporation would be able to accept outside contributions to SatCat5.\\\\nWe felt that a Contribtor License Agreement (CLA) is less invasive than a full copyright assignment.\\n\\\\n\\nThe CLA protects the rights of The Aerospace Corporation, our customers, and you as the contributor.\\\\n\\nYou can find our CLA and related information here\\n.\\n\\\\n\\nWhat parts of SatCat5 are patented?\\n\\\\n\\nWe currently hold one relevant US patent, number US11055254B2,\\\\ntitled \\\\\\\"Mixed Media Ethernet Switch\\\\\\\".\\n\\\\n\\nWe have applied for a patent on VERDACT (fka \\\\\\\"Vernier Phase Locked Loop\\\\\\\"),\\\\nwhich is used to generate cross-clock timestamps for PTP.\\n\\\\n\\nIn accordance with SatCat5's open-source license agreement,\\\\nwe grant a royalty-free license for use of these technologies.\\\\nRefer to section 7 of the CERN-OHL-W v2 license for details.\\n\\\\n\\nCopyright Notice\\n\\\\n\\nCopyright 2019-2024 The Aerospace Corporation\\n\\\\n\\nThis file is a part of SatCat5, licensed under CERN-OHL-W v2 or later.\\n\\\\n\\nYou may redistribute and modify SatCat5 and make products using it under\\\\nthe weakly reciprocal variant of the CERN Open Hardware License, version 2\\\\nor (at your option) any later weakly reciprocal version.\\n\\\\n\\nSatCat5 is distributed WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY, INCLUDING\\\\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\\\\nPURPOSE.

The amount of bloatware was incredible. Various social networks and shopping apps were preinstalled. In addition to all the Samsung apps that more or less duplicate the Google stack, poorly.

My suspicion is that they bought a phone through a carrier. Carriers push tons of weird bloatware onto their users (which is probably why their models are cheaper). If you just buy a phone, I don't think there will be any obvious bloatware on Samsung phones. There are some duplicate apps, but I'm pretty sure that's limited to Chrome vs Samsung Internet and Google Play vs Samsung Store.\\nMy tablet came with a weird Google Now replacement that I can't remove, but that's the only bloatware I really encountered. The rest was free versions of paid apps like drawing software and the standard Samsung suite. No weird shopping apps, no ads anywhere, just what I wanted for the tablet.\\nXiaomi is pretty bad, though. It kind of makes sense, because they need to develop their software for China, where there is no Google cloud, so they've become their own Google. Every app prompts for agreeing with a privacy statement. Some models of phones actually include ads in the system apps (which can be disabled by a setting, but it's still a problem). Their privacy policy is also a blatant lie. I love the bang-for-the-buck nature of Xiaomi phones, but I wouldn't buy them unless there's a good custom ROM available.

It kind of works!\\nGetting this working involved fleshing out a lot more of the Windows API. The\\ndemoscene executables I had been focusing on up to this point mostly brought up\\na window and sent pixels to it, while Minesweeper's startup pokes at the\\nregistry, ini files, and in particular has a bunch of drawing code. If you click\\n\\\"view in debugger\\\" in the above UI and then \\\"imports\\\" you can see a list of all\\nof the various Windows API that this pulls in and which I have (partially)\\nimplemented.\\nFor example, the red numbers in the UI come from bottom-up bitmaps that are\\nstored as 4 bits per pixel and which are 13 pixels wide, so each row uses 6.5\\nbytes. I briefly went down a rabbithole of reasoning about generically decoding\\nthese before I realized the BMP format uses padding.\\nGetting Minesweeper to render definitely makes this project feel more \\\"real\\\" and\\nI think is a cool demo, but I also am not really sure I ultimately want to\\nreimplement a bunch of old Windows APIs. For example, I looked a bit into\\nSkiFree. It has 1bpp bitmaps and various raster ops and I am just not too sure\\nit is interesting.\\nIntrospecting, I think I looked at Minesweeper because I was curious to see how\\nhard it would be, but also because I was just avoiding The Big Scary Bug.\\nThe Big Scary Bug\\nLast November I posted about an emulator CPU bug\\n:\\nto resummarize, a demo worked when using Apple's CPU emulator but not mine, but\\nit manifested as just the demo doing the wrong thing and not as any smoking gun\\ncrash.\\nHere are some of the approaches I have tried to isolate this bug over the last\\nfew months:\\nTracing the executable on native Windows\\nand my emulator and comparing execution traces; failed because native\\nexecution is too different from my emulator\\nIntegrating a 3rd CPU emulator (Unicorn)\\nand comparing execution traces; failed because I couldn't get Unicorn to\\nreliably report CPU state, possibly due to either bugs in it or how I\\ninteracted with it\\nFiguring out\\nenough of the LLDB API\\nto attempt to get it to dump an execution trace of running under Rosetta;\\nfailed because I got the traces closer but they still just diverged at some\\npoint, and also the LLDB API is very frustrating \\u2014 how can I print an 80-bit\\nx86 float, still not even sure!\\nIn any case I put it all on the back burner while I fiddled with Minesweeper for\\na bit.\\nThen today I was looking over my notes on different demos I had tried in the\\nemulator and for one my note on why it didn't work was \\\"uses lots of windows\\napis, CreateDIBSection bitmap flags, SetTimer, etc\\\". And I thought, huh, I\\nrecently have implemented that kind of thing, I should try it again...\\n...and it gets much farther along, before of course encountering some other\\nproblems, including that it somehow is underflowing the FPU stack. As I glanced\\nthrough some of the FPU code around its stack handling, I randomly noticed that\\nI had typo-misimplemented the\\nfild\\ninstruction. It is supposed to take a\\n64-bit\\ninteger\\nfrom memory and put it on the FPU stack (converting it to a\\nfloat), but I had made it take a 64-bit\\nfloat\\nfrom memory and put it on the\\nstack.\\nThis did not fix this new demo, but apparently it did fix the four month long\\nbug. Argh.\\nTest suite\\nI think this is the third dumb typo bug I've discovered in my FPU\\nimplementation, where all three would have been caught if I had had even the\\nmost trivial of tests (e.g. to test multiplication, \\\"does 2 * 3 produce 6?\\\"). I\\nnoticed if I pasted some of the relevant code into an LLM\\nit was able to spot one\\n, but also\\nwhen I pasted the whole file into the same LLM it couldn't find those bugs nor\\nthe new one. Someday soon though, maybe?\\nI have been circling around writing an x86 CPU test suite because I haven't been\\nsure exactly which way in which I want to test my implementation. There's of\\ncourse the \\\"does it work at all\\\" tests which would have caught these bugs, but\\nthere are also lots of cases that would only be exercised by particular inputs,\\nlike whether the overflow flag gets set based on particular combinations of\\ninputs. I have a basic approach at this that I have written in C but updating it\\nis pretty annoying; I even as far as building out\\nGitHub CI goop to compile this C\\nvia the MSVC toolchain\\n.\\nMy most recent retrowin32 update,\\nabout cross-compiling Rust\\n,\\nwas prompted exactly by the thought of writing this test suite in Rust.\\nOne recent idea I had for those is that I could just exhaustively run all\\ncombinations of inputs for the implementations of operations that involve 8-bit\\nintegers \\u2014 there are only 2**16 of them \\u2014 and compare these against a native\\nCPU implementation. It has the downside that wouldn't flush out bugs in the 16\\nor 32-bit implementations, but for many of these I have written them as generics\\nover the operand size\\n(\\nexample\\n)\\nso maybe it would be enough.\\nWine on Mac on Rosetta\\nBy the way, if you actually wanted to run Minesweeper on your Mac, recent\\nreleases on Wine do\\nthe 32-bit x86 on 64-bit Rosetta thing\\n\\u2014 after all, I learned about it from Wine \\u2014 and Wine is a much more competent\\nimplementation than mine. At this point you can just\\nbrew install wine-stable\\nand then\\nwine some.exe\\nand it will work, even on Apple silicon.\\nWith that in hand, what is even the point of my own project? Of course, the\\nultimate goal is just my own interest, but does Wine subsume its functionality?\\nIt turns out the\\none demo that got me started on this whole thing\\nstill crashes under Rosetta due to an illegal instruction. Just guessing, but it\\nappears Rosetta doesn't implement the \\\"nested pointers\\\" variants of the\\nenter\\ninstruction\\nthat chillin\\nuses. So at least until they fix that, I still have a (totally made-up) purpose.\"}\n",

HTML5 specifies the exact behavior of what every browser must do upon encountering tag-soup, which is useful because real-world HTML has been tag-soup for a very long time.\\nI guess the strictest thing you can do is to die upon encountering \\\"validation errors\\\", but I don't think this would help much to simplify your job. (Maybe you can drop the adoption agency?) But now your parser chokes on a lot of websites - likely on hand-written HTML, which has a greater potential for validation errors but also typically simpler layout.\\nAnd HTML parsing is still the\\neasy\\npart of writing a browser! Layout is much harder to do, partly because layout is hard, but also because it's under-specified. Implement \\\"undefined behavior\\\" in a way that other browsers don't, and your browser won't work on a lot of pages.\\n(There have been improvements, but HTML is still miles ahead. e.g. CSS 2 has no automatic table layout algorithm, and AFAICT the CSS 3 version is still \\\"not yet ready for implementation\\\".)\\nreply\\nCJefferson\\n10 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nWhy would you want a web browser which can't open Facebook, X, or half of the other top websites?\\nAnd why would they bother to \\\"fix\\\" their websites when they work fine in Chrome, Edge and Firefox, but not in your very unpopular but super-strict browser?\\nreply\\nramijames\\n12 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nI think of the web like I think about Windows.

I think the top-down approach applied at the project level is much nicer because it allows you to _start from somewhere_ and then iteratively improve things.\\nThat is not to say you shouldn't take precautions.

Kind of neat for 1998, by 2008 it was clear that's no longer a good fit for making a browser. Despite heroic efforts and many advances, Firefox has never really been able to close the gap to more recent browsers. And (statistically) nobody makes new browsers based on Firefox, it's effectively a design dead end.\\nIt can be hard to retrofit 'complicated but decent parser with a js runtime attached' to something like 'safe parser of arbitrarily adversarial inputs connected to an open RCE' (i.e. something akin to a modern browser) if the latter wasn't a fundamental design goal to start with.\\nreply\\nzimbatm\\n2 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nWho said the goal was to create a production browser?\\nThis seems like a pure passion project: to return to the pleasure of building something just for the sake of it.

So today we\\u2019ll be using \\u201c\\nDomato\\n\\ud83c\\udf45\\n\\u201d, a DOM fuzzer from\\nGoogle Project Zero\\n, to stress test Ladybird and fix some issues found along the way.\\nThe way this works is that Domato generates randomized web pages with lots of mostly-valid but strange HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I then load these pages into a debug build of Ladybird and observe what happens.\\nDomato generates HTML pages of roughly 500 KiB in size, filled with \\u201cinteresting\\u201d JS, CSS and HTML to surprise and delight your browser engine!\\nThe Domato README boasts a ton of bugs discovered in all major browsers, so I have no doubt it will find some in ours as well. Here we go!\\nIssue #1: <th> inside <mfrac>\\nUnsurprisingly, it took less than a second to find the first issue! The output produced by Domato is actually 562 KiB, but I was able to reduce it to the following:\\n<body>\\n<script>\\nlet mfrac = document.createElement(\\\"mfrac\\\");\\nmfrac.appendChild(document.createElement(\\\"th\\\"));\\ndocument.body.appendChild(mfrac);\\n</script>\\nI\\u2019ve compiled Ladybird with UBSAN (Undefined Behavior SANitizer) for this test, and I get the following very helpful trace output:\\nLibWeb/HTML/HTMLTableCellElement.cpp:55:36: runtime error: member call on null pointer of type 'Web::DOM::Node'\\n#0 0x7e9bfa1610dd in table_containing_cell LibWeb/HTML/HTMLTableCellElement.cpp:55:36\\n#1 0x7e9bfa1610dd in Web::HTML::HTMLTableCellElement::apply_presentational_hints(Web::CSS::StyleProperties&) const LibWeb/HTML/HTMLTableCellElement.cpp:101:33\\n#2 0x7e9bf97c22d1 in Web::CSS::StyleComputer::compute_cascaded_values(Web::CSS::StyleProperties&, Web::DOM::Element&, AK::Optional<Web::CSS::Selector::PseudoElement::Type>, bool&, Web::CSS::StyleComputer::ComputeStyleMode) const LibWeb/CSS/StyleComputer.cpp:1448:17\\n#3 0x7e9bf97e5899 in Web::CSS::StyleComputer::compute_style_impl(Web::DOM::Element&, AK::Optional<Web::CSS::Selector::PseudoElement::Type>, Web::CSS::StyleComputer::ComputeStyleMode) const LibWeb/CSS/StyleComputer.cpp:2231:5\\n#4 0x7e9bf97e447e in Web::CSS::StyleComputer::compute_style(Web::DOM::Element&, AK::Optional<Web::CSS::Selector::PseudoElement::Type>) const LibWeb/CSS/StyleComputer.cpp:2202:12\\n#5 0x7e9bf9a7e60c in Web::DOM::Element::recompute_style() LibWeb/DOM/Element.cpp:575:64\\nIt\\u2019s a good old-fashioned null pointer dereference!\\nAs it turns out, we\\u2019ve implemented\\n<th>\\nand\\n<td>\\nelements with the assumption that there\\u2019s always a\\n<table>\\nsomewhere above it in the DOM tree. We probably believed this because the following is not allowed by the HTML parser:\\n<mfrac><th>\\nIf you load the above markup in a spec-compliant browser, it will create a single\\n<mfrac>\\nelement with nothing inside it.\\nHowever, when creating DOM nodes manually using JavaScript API, you can break some of the rules that the parser has to follow, and indeed put a\\n<th>\\ninside an\\n<mfrac>\\n!\\nHere\\u2019s the buggy function:\\nHTMLTableElement const& table_containing_cell(HTMLTableCellElement const& node)\\n{\\nauto parent_node = node.parent();\\nwhile (!is<HTML::HTMLTableElement>(parent_node))\\nparent_node = parent_node->parent();\\nreturn static_cast<HTML::HTMLTableElement const&>(*parent_node);\\n}\\nIt\\u2019s used to implement the ancient feature where\\n<table border=3>\\nand\\n<table padding=5>\\napplies CSS border and padding to each table cell, and not just the table box itself.\\nThe fix is simply to stop assuming that\\n<th>\\nand\\n<td>\\nelements always have a containing\\n<table>\\nin the ancestor chain. We don\\u2019t need the\\ntable_containing_cell\\nhelper but can instead simply replace this:\\nauto const& table_element = table_containing_cell(*this);\\nWith this:\\nauto const table_element = first_ancestor_of_type<HTMLTableElement>();\\nif (!table_element)\\nreturn;\\nAnd we\\u2019re done with issue #1!\\n(Fix committed here.)\\nIssue #2: Assigning window event handlers in detached DOM\\nWe continue executing the fuzzer and once again, within less than 1 second, we hit a new problem. The Domato output is 472 KiB, but it whittles down to this:\\n<script>\\nvar parser = new DOMParser();\\nvar doc = parser.parseFromString(\\\"\\\", \\\"text/html\\\");\\nvar body = doc.createElement(\\\"body\\\");\\nbody.onblur = null;\\n</script>\\nWhen opened in Ladybird, we fail like so:\\nVERIFICATION FAILED: m_ptr at LibJS/Heap/GCPtr.h:174\\n#1\\u00a0 JS::GCPtr<Web::HTML::Window>::operator* at LibJS/Heap/GCPtr.h:174\\n#2\\u00a0 Web::DOM::Document::window at LibWeb/DOM/Document.h:320\\n#3\\u00a0 Web::HTML::HTMLBodyElement::global_event_handlers_to_event_target at LibWeb/HTML/HTMLBodyElement.cpp:104\\n#4\\u00a0 Web::HTML::GlobalEventHandlers::set_onblur at LibWeb/HTML/GlobalEventHandlers.cpp:24\\n#5\\u00a0 Web::Bindings::HTMLElementPrototype::onblur_setter at LibWeb/Bindings/HTMLElementPrototype.cpp:1153\\nThe reason things go wrong here is due to the special behavior of\\nonfoo\\nevent handler attributes on the\\n<body>\\nelement. For compatibility with ancient web content, assignments to\\ndocument.body.onfoo\\nmust forward to\\nwindow.onfoo\\n. However, documents created via\\nDOMParser\\ndo not have a window object!\\nIt turns out we\\u2019ve misunderstood this detail in our implementation, and structured our internal object model as if every document always has a window. Oops!\\nThe fix is to make\\nDocument::window()\\nreturn a nullable value, and then handle null in a bajillion places. When assigning\\ndocument.body.onblur\\nin a window-less document, we now simply do nothing, same as other browsers.\\n(Fix committed here.)\\nIssue #3: Infinite recursion in SVG <linearGradient>\\nModern browsers have to support SVG both inline in HTML, and also as an external image format. This adds a whole host of new edge cases and interesting interactions.\\nFor example, SVG allows declaring gradients that reference other gradients to inherit their colors. As it turns out, we hadn\\u2019t considered the case where a gradient references itself:\\n<svg>\\n<linearGradient id=\\\"oops\\\" href=\\\"#oops\\\"/>\\n<rect fill=\\\"url(#oops)\\\" />\\n</svg>\\nThe SVG above would cause our implementation to loop forever as it attempted to follow the chain of referenced gradients. Oops, indeed!\\nThe obvious fix is to stop following the chain of linked gradients if the current gradient references itself. However, that doesn\\u2019t cover reference cycles that span multiple steps like so:\\n<svg>\\n<linearGradient id=\\\"lol\\\" href=\\\"#lmao\\\"/>\\n<linearGradient id=\\\"lmao\\\" href=\\\"#even\\\"/>\\n<linearGradient id=\\\"even\\\" href=\\\"#lol\\\"/>\\n<rect fill=\\\"url(#lol)\\\" />\\n</svg>\\nTo properly handle cyclical references, we have to keep track of all the gradients we\\u2019ve visited, and stop following the chain if we encounter a gradient we\\u2019ve already visited before.\\nCuriously, Firefox actually complains about these kind of gradients in their developer console:\\n(Fix committed here.)\\nIssue #4: Accessing the window properties of a removed iframe\\nThis one is interesting:\\n<iframe></iframe>\\n<script>\\nwindow.onload = function() {\\nlet iframe = document.querySelector(\\\"iframe\\\")\\nlet iframeWindow = iframe.contentWindow;\\niframe.remove();\\niframeWindow.getSelection();\\n}\\n</script>\\nThe above test would crash like this:\\nLibWeb/HTML/WindowProxy.cpp:161:136: runtime error: reference binding to null pointer of type 'const BrowsingContext'\\n#0 0x77367675cadf in Web::HTML::WindowProxy::internal_get(JS::PropertyKey const&, JS::Value, JS::CacheablePropertyMetadata*) const LibWeb/HTML/WindowProxy.cpp:161:5\\n#1 0x773670c4fcca in JS::Bytecode::get_by_id(JS::VM&, AK::DeprecatedFlyString const&, JS::Value, JS::Value, JS::Bytecode::PropertyLookupCache&) LibJS/Bytecode/CommonImplementations.h:105:18\\n#2 0x773670c182d5 in JS::Bytecode::Op::GetById::execute_impl(JS::Bytecode::Interpreter&) const LibJS/Bytecode/Interpreter.cpp:1088:28\\n#3 0x773670bc8e1f in execute LibJS/Bytecode/Op.h:1898:9\\n#4 0x773670bc8e1f in JS::Bytecode::Interpreter::run_bytecode() LibJS/Bytecode/Interpreter.cpp:409:38\\nAs it turns out, this is actually a bug in the HTML spec! When an iframe is removed from the DOM, its content document is detached from its browsing context. However, when getting or setting a property on a window object, we run a spec algorithm called\\n\\\"check if an access between two browsing contexts should be reported\\\"\\nwhich inspects the browsing context of the \\u201caccessor\\u201d and \\u201caccessed\\u201d window. The spec incorrectly assumed that both windows have an associated browsing context at the time of property access.\\nI\\u2019ve opened an issue against the HTML spec\\n, and patched this in Ladybird in the meantime by adding a null check.\\nFinding spec bugs is actually one of my favorite things while working on Ladybird. It allows us to improve the specs for everyone by submitting a bug report or fix.\\n(Fix committed here.)\\nIssue #5: Infinite looping in Element.before()\\nWhen opening the next page, it just wouldn\\u2019t finish loading.

The earlier design, which held the\\nGuinness World Record\\nfor the world\\u2019s oldest packaging, had remained essentially unchanged since 1883, a year that also ushered in the first rodeo, overhead wires being used for electric lighting systems, and the discovery of Cholera bacteria. It featured embellished frames and detailed filigrees as well as an illustration of a slain lion surrounded by insects \\u2014 an Old Testament reference, chosen by Lyle\\u2019s religious founder, to the lion killed by Samson whose body was infested by a hive of bees after death (\\u201cout of the strong came forth sweetness,\\u201d as the package said). The new modernised design, developed internally by the Lyle\\u2019s team, retains many of the same visual conceits as its Victorian predecessor: a symmetrical arch, a gold and green colour palette, organic ornaments, and uppercase typography. It also retains the lion, albeit updated, simplified, and re-animated into a smiling animal head comprised of drops of syrup. But despite all attempts at a gentle transition \\u201cinto the modern day,\\u201d as Lyle\\u2019s brand director James Whitley put it, the response has been swift and decisive: people hate it. They\\nreally\\nhate it. In fact, when It\\u2019s Nice That shared news of the rebrand\\non Instagram\\n, responses ranged from \\u201cI need to call my therapist\\u201d to \\u201cthis ruined my day.\\u201d So... what happened?\\nAs an American, I don\\u2019t have the same nostalgia for Lyle\\u2019s as my UK compatriots (to be honest, I\\u2019m not even sure what Golden Syrup is used for), but I felt the loss of the old design all the same. Much of this is due to my being a maximalist at heart; I simply prefer the busy look of the old tin to the sleek blandness of the new one. I also\\ncanonically\\ncare about old stuff! But the charm of the original tin isn\\u2019t its intrinsic age. Rather, it\\u2019s what that age signifies about the tin\\u2019s creation and its place in history. The original Lyle\\u2019s tin, like much late-19th Century packaging, was made at the peak of the industrial revolution \\u2013\\u00a0a period characterised by a\\nwave of experimentation\\nin printed materials, when branding was in its infancy, and graphic design still deeply intertwined with the traditions of print culture and fine art. Lyle\\u2019s old tin isn\\u2019t just arbitrarily historic; it\\u2019s specifically\\nVictorian\\n. The intricate aesthetic of the 1883 design is a direct product of the techniques and visual norms of its time. If the 1883 tin is an art history index fossil, the new packaging finds itself in art history purgatory instead, unanchored by time or tradition. It lacks the distinctive qualities or artistic cues that tether it to a rich past or propel it firmly into contemporary relevance.\\nOf course, putting aesthetics and cultural salience aside, I do understand that when it comes to subject matter, there are obvious\\nreasons\\nwhy a rotting carcass is a bad mascot for a food brand. The same goes for obscure biblical references (\\u201cthe story of it coming from religious belief could put the brand in an exclusionary space, especially if it was to go viral on TikTok,\\u201d Helen Edwards, a professor of marketing at London Business School, told the\\nBBC\\n.) And yet, the unexpected contradiction of a dead lion surrounded by delicate scrollwork was precisely what made the old Lyle\\u2019s tin so good, and so distinctive. The original packaging, macabre as it may be, is an artefact of the days before brand strategy and focus groups. It wasn\\u2019t overly concerned with what consumers wanted (though Christian doctrine did likely resonate with a Victorian audience more than a 21st century one). Instead, it simply reflected what was important to the founder personally. All the focus groups and visual research in the world can\\u2019t replicate that kind of authenticity.\\nAnd while my personal taste (\\ntackled last time\\n!) leans towards the historic, consumer behaviour also suggests a broader predilection towards heritage and the perceived authenticity it affords, even when that heritage isn\\u2019t attached to a superior aesthetic. In fact, public preferences often lean towards traditional or seemingly \\u201cworse\\u201d designs, so long as they\\u2019re backed by an appropriate connection to nostalgia. One notable example is the recent rebrand of Bahlsen, a renowned German biscuit manufacturer. In 2021,\\nBahlsen\\u2019s redesign\\nwas acclaimed by the design community for its clean, bold modernity (even winning them a D&AD award). Nonetheless, the rebrand resulted in a\\n12% drop in sales\\nthe following year. This decline was attributed to a variety of factors: low on-shelf recognition, reduced emotional resonance, and smaller, less appetising photos than the original, \\u201cdated\\u201d packaging. In other words, even if the branding was good, it didn\\u2019t feel right.\\nThe emotional connection we have with packaging, compared to other forms of commercial art like posters or magazines, seems to run deep. I think this is because packaging is the set dressing of daily life; it\\u2019s the diaper box seen in the corner of a baby photo, the perfume vial on your older sister\\u2019s dresser, or the\\nexpired ketchup bottle\\nlingering in the back of your parent\\u2019s fridge. Like Proust\\u2019s Madeleine, these branded items, often unnoticed in the moment, become imbued with nostalgia in retrospect, evoking profound feelings of comfort and recognition upon sight. This emotional potency makes packaging a powerful tool for brands. By maintaining or reverting to heritage designs, brands can tap into a reservoir of collective subconscious, triggering involuntary memories that foster a profound emotional connection. Nostalgia doesn\\u2019t just evoke fond memories either: it also creates a sense of trust and safety, as evidenced in the sharp\\nincrease\\nin nostalgic content during the height of the pandemic.\\nEstablished brands have long enjoyed the advantages of consumer recognition and longevity, but it is a relatively recent development that they have started to fully leverage their heritage as a strategic asset. This shift is particularly noticeable in the\\nwave of retro rebrands that swept through 2021\\n, affecting a wide array of legacy brands from Colt 45 and Campbell\\u2019s Soup to ABC, Zagat, and Peugeot. These rebranding efforts signal a deeper acknowledgment within the industry that heritage conveys a mark of quality and trustworthiness. In a market so crowded with new brands that multiple editorial platforms exist simply to help us parse through them (\\nWirecutter\\n,\\nThe Strategist\\n,\\nCPGD\\n,\\nSnaxshot\\n, etc.), heritage packaging can be a powerful testament to a company\\u2019s enduring value. It\\u2019s an implicit endorsement from generations of consumers\\u2014even if\\nyour\\ngrandma never used this, someone else\\u2019s probably did. If they\\u2019ve existed for this long, they must be doing something right! Plus, why fall in love with a brand that might not stick around, or at least not use the same product formula, after their next round of fundraising? Even brands that aren\\u2019t sure about a full return to heritage are tapping into the throwback renaissance by re-releasing products with historic packaging on a limited edition basis, often keeping the change for good after positive response, as in the case of beer brand Natty Light\\u2019s\\nreturn to its 1979 packaging\\n.\\nBut what happens if you don\\u2019t have a legacy to tap? Increasingly, brands without an archive to mine are finding you can fake one for nearly the same effect. This strategy, employed by a multitude of brands \\u2013\\u00a0though it seems especially common in the alcohol industry, with 1930s-inspired\\nFestif Liqueur\\nand Balholm\\nfruit wine\\nor\\napple brandy\\nbeing personal favourites \\u2013 demonstrates that the semblance of heritage can influence consumer perception and confidence irrespective of its factual accuracy. Heritage design may be art history without footnotes, but consumers, it seems, are less concerned with the authenticity of a brand\\u2019s legacy than the feelings of nostalgia and reliability that such narratives evoke. Even brands that do tap into their own history, like\\nJones Knowles Ritchie\\u2019s retro rebrand for Burger King\\n, are often more fiction than fact. Despite being characterised in the press as a throwback, Lisa Smith, executive creative director at JKR, said the system was \\u201c\\nnever meant to be an homage\\n,\\u201d and in fact relied on a typeface that intentionally hybridised many eras and styles together. This mash-up approach to visual history, or as my friend Michael Diaz-Griffith calls it, \\u201c\\nStrange Historicism\\n,\\u201d is the new normal; equally a product of logistics (historic branding doesn\\u2019t map well onto modern use cases) and a culture typified by fast trend cycles and a casual approach to fact-checking.\\nJust as the Victorian era\\u2019s industrial revolution shaped Lyle\\u2019s original packaging, today\\u2019s rapid technological advancements and cultural shifts are redefining what \\u2018heritage\\u2019 means to a new generation, too. Though brands have traditionally drawn on pre-1960s aesthetics to signal value and evoke emotional responses, timelessness is always evolving to include more recent decades as consumer demographics come of age. You only have to look at wistfulness for\\n2014 Tumblr\\nor\\ndigicams\\nto remember that \\u201cthings were better back then\\u201d and \\u201cthey just don\\u2019t make \\u2019em like they used to\\u201d are entirely relative (see also: \\u201c\\nno one wants to work anymore\\n\\u201d being a phenomenon almost as old as the original Lyle\\u2019s tin). If\\nPepsi\\u2019s return to their 90s logo\\nand the success of brands like\\nVacation\\n(\\nfaux 1980s\\n),\\nTacombi\\n(faux 1990s), or\\nGood Weird\\n(faux 2000s) are any indicator, heritage is a moving target. Today\\u2019s innovations are tomorrow\\u2019s nostalgia.\\nI love design history, and I\\u2019ll be sad when, inevitably, more old designs get retired and this era of heritage-forward branding passes. But I also suspect that too much focus on the past \\u2014 my own obsessions included \\u2013 can prevent us from finding new things we love, too. What we sacrifice in losing the trust and nostalgia of heritage aesthetics might be easily replaced by the excitement and innovation of the truly new. And as\\nAvery Trufelman\\n, writer and host of sartorial podcast\\nArticles of Interest\\n, says, there\\u2019s a certain charm in embracing the spirit of the moment, even if it means accepting the inevitable obsolescence of a design.

This makes them very inconvenient to scan as they don\\u2019t fit on a regular scanner, and as such we needed a much bigger scanner. A0 scanners are particularly scarce, especially on the used market, and they command a high price (usually in the thousands).

The last few weeks have consisted primarily of anticipation, excitement, and towards the end, utter exhaustion. But finally, FINALLY, the IBM is home! It all started after our friend John Oates at the register shared our plight as detailed in our last blog post (see here).

Vincent's\\nDjango for Beginners\\n[1],\\nDjango for APIs\\nand\\nDjango for Professionals\\nwas a turning point in my career. I started to take myself seriously as a developer, not just an electrical engineering grad who happened to like coding.\\nNot SICP as a teen, not the Haskell Book, not\\nThe Art of Unix Programming\\n, not\\nA Philosophy of Software Design\\n. Those are all fantastic books, but they were the wrong things to read for someone whose definition of \\\"Keep It Simple, Stupid\\\" was \\\"never build anything at all and stay unemployed\\\". Django got me to\\nshut up and build\\n.\\nAnd build I did, and most of it did and does suck, and that's okay. And then I got a job, not doing Django, but using the things I learned from actually building with Django every day. I owe Django a great deal, and I still think of the DRF as my favorite approach to building a \\\"well-tempered\\\", maintainable API, on a deadline.\\n[1]:\\nhttps://djangoforbeginners.com/\\nreply\\negeozcan\\n1 hour ago\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nI have a very similar relationship with .NET MVC + EF. I suppose Django would win against it (them) by a mile in the \\\"batteries included\\\" battle but oh boy was I productive with it, especially with some jQuery and knockout.js for the frontend. I really felt like I could build anything CRUD with the tools I had (I was specialized in system integration) and I had the fortune of getting paid for it. Now even the smallest memory of some of the code I've written back then makes me cringe, but I learned a lot.\\nFrom those experiences you not only learn what to do, you get \\\"what not to do\\\" and \\\"ah these parts are useful because of this\\\" kind of information as well.\\nreply\\ngiancarlostoro\\n3 minutes ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nHaving done both in my career I would pick either one depending on various factors but they both can get the job done.\\nOne edge of Python is its like the modern day Perl in terms of how many libraries you can use with it to get things done. It certainly feels that way anyway.\\nOn the other hand .NET has cool things Python barely scratches the surface on like MAUI and Blazor.

I love the batteries included approach over flask and the ORM is simply amazing. I tried a couple times to use DFR but never really stuck with it, my reason was that my html templates have a lot of dependency on views and I just find the idea of using DRF to decouple front end and back end hard.

Start by identifying where you have a pure data dependency that\\u2019s currently doing a round trip to render HTML redundantly or unnecessarily, and think about whether it can be served as both HTML and pure data via content negotiation.

Because it so nicely supports stateless request handling without long running processes.\\nIn PHP, you can just throw a php file on a webserver and it works. To update, you just update the file. You don't have to restart anything.\\nOn the dev machine, you can just have Vim in one window and Firefox in the other, change code, hit F5, and you see what you did.\\nI don't like having to run a code watching process which then recompiles the whole codebase every time I save a file.\\nreply\\nhiAndrewQuinn\\n4 hours ago\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nPHP is underrated, especially as a learning resource. I'm very surprised I only ever built something with vanilla PHP on the job a few months ago - and how fast I could go from idea to prototype.\\nThere is a very natural learning progression to: First build apps that run purely locally; then build a few static websites, maybe starting with hand-crafted HTML and eventually using something like Hugo; then build a small dynamic website with vanilla PHP; then finally build something with a more complex framework, like Laravel or Django. Going upwards in these iterations I think would help a lot ofd newer devs internalize where the tradeoffs of inital complexity vs. future ease of development lands for them.\\nreply\\nfulafel\\n4 hours ago\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nIf PHP doesn't recompile your script imports, how does the reload tracking work with dependencies? Or does it punt somehow (eg only reloads your script but not is imports)?\\nThere are various implementations of this kind of autoreload system for Python but it always seems to come with compromises on semantics (different initialization order causes behaviour differences).\\nreply\\nraziel2p\\n1 hour ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nIn PHP, dependencies are just .php files just like your own code, it all works the same.\\nPHP code is also typically far less complex than Python modules - modern PHP code consists of a single index.php with procedural code, and everything else is just class / function definitions, so there are no side effects.\\nreply\\nJonathanBeuys\\n4 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nImports are also updated the moment you update the imported file.\\nI'm not sure if PHP stores any compiled binary or byte-code at all. Maybe it compiles it all on each request. It's super fast though, even with tons of imports.\\nMy guess would be that it keeps compiled versions of each file in memory and on each request, it walks down the whole import path. And when it encounters a changed import, it compiles only that one.\\nWould be cool if someone with more knowledge could shed a light on what is actually happening.\\nreply\\ndsego\\n4 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nAfaik, PHP can have opcode caching enabled or disabled.\\nreply\\nJonathanBeuys\\n3 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nTrue.

In case we don't want to reload everything and run from scratch, it's pretty easy to do with python too. But we \\\"chose\\\" to run it always and quick reload, so the requests aren't too slow [and scalable].\\nRest of the things you mentioned are pretty same for Python as well.\\nreply\\nJonathanBeuys\\n4 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nYou talk about performance, but I think that is another point for PHP. In my experience, PHP handles the same requests faster.\\nYes, I could build everything from scratch myself in Python and have the same statelessnes as in PHP. But parsing headers, creating headers etc feels like it should be handled by a framework. In PHP, it is build right in.\\nAnd if I would build it, it would talk to the webserver via CGI.

PHP was created for the web whereas web programming support in python wasn't part of the language design. When you speak about web programming in python, the seam between the language and the web is usually a wsgi/agsi layer. This is where all the things you mentioned come into play. There's a whole lot of benefit imo to using python over php beyond that seam.\\nreply\\nsebra\\n3 hours ago\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nAs a long time Django and DRF user I'm really happy this release finally got out. If you look at the PRs being released some of them are years old. It's true that DRF is a mature and feature-complete framework but Django is still evolving slowly and DRF must keep up with that at the very minimum. Big thanks to the maintainers for getting it out!\\nHere are some of my hilights from this relase:\\n* Default on model gets sent to API docs\\n* Orderedict replaced by plain dicts everywhere - plain dicts are ordered in python since 3.6 so this is a welcome simplification\\n* Automatic support for UniqueConstraints in ModelSerializers - this is one of the places where DRF were lagging behind. I found myself using the deprecated unique_together just to not bother with writing validators on all my serializers\\n* There is a new router supporting path converters instead of regexp - Looking forward to trying this out!

You should be able to upgrade between minor point releases without any other code changes.\\nMedium version numbers (0.x.0) may include API changes, in line with the\\ndeprecation policy\\n.  You should read the release notes carefully before upgrading between medium point releases.\\nMajor version numbers (x.0.0) are reserved for substantial project milestones.\\nDeprecation policy\\nREST framework releases follow a formal deprecation policy, which is in line with\\nDjango's deprecation policy\\n.\\nThe timeline for deprecation of a feature present in version 1.0 would work as follows:\\nVersion 1.1 would remain\\nfully backwards compatible\\nwith 1.0, but would raise\\nRemovedInDRF13Warning\\nwarnings, subclassing\\nPendingDeprecationWarning\\n, if you use the feature that are due to be deprecated.  These warnings are\\nsilent by default\\n, but can be explicitly enabled when you're ready to start migrating any required changes.  For example if you start running your tests using\\npython -Wd manage.py test\\n, you'll be warned of any API changes you need to make.\\nVersion 1.2 would escalate these warnings to subclass\\nDeprecationWarning\\n, which is loud by default.\\nVersion 1.3 would remove the deprecated bits of API entirely.\\nNote that in line with Django's policy, any parts of the framework not mentioned in the documentation should generally be considered private API, and may be subject to change.\\nUpgrading\\nTo upgrade Django REST framework to the latest version, use pip:\\npip install -U djangorestframework\\nYou can determine your currently installed version using\\npip show\\n:\\npip show djangorestframework\\n3.15.x series\\n3.15.0\\nDate: 15th March 2024\\nDjango 5.0 and Python 3.12 support [[#9157] (https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/pull/9157)]\\nUse POST method instead of GET to perform logout in browsable API [[9208] (https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/pull/9208)]\\nAdded jQuery 3.7.1 support & dropped previous version [\\n#9094\\n]\\nUse str as default path converter [\\n#9066\\n]\\nDocument support for http.HTTPMethod in the @action decorator added in Python 3.11 [\\n#9067\\n]\\nUpdate exceptions.md [\\n#9071\\n]\\nPartial serializer should not have required fields [\\n#7563\\n]\\nPropagate 'default' from model field to serializer field.

a\\ndefault\\nvalue would use the\\ndefault\\nfor create and update operations.\\nIn order to maintain the old behaviour you may need to pass the value of\\nread_only\\nfields when calling\\nsave()\\nin\\nthe view:\\ndef perform_create(self, serializer):\\nserializer.save(owner=self.request.user)\\nAlternatively you may override\\nsave()\\nor\\ncreate()\\nor\\nupdate()\\non the serializer as appropriate.\\nCorrect allow_null behaviour when required=False\\n#5888\\nWithout an explicit\\ndefault\\n,\\nallow_null\\nimplies a default of\\nnull\\nfor outgoing serialization. Previously such\\nfields were being skipped when read-only or otherwise not required.\\nPossible backwards compatibility break\\nif you were relying on such fields being excluded from the outgoing\\nrepresentation. In order to restore the old behaviour you can override\\ndata\\nto exclude the field when\\nNone\\n.\\nFor example:\\n@property\\ndef data(self):\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nDrop `maybe_none` field if None.\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\ndata = super().data\\nif 'maybe_none' in data and data['maybe_none'] is None:\\ndel data['maybe_none']\\nreturn data\\nRefactor dynamic route generation and improve viewset action introspectibility.\\n#5705\\nViewSet\\ns have been provided with new attributes and methods that allow\\nit to introspect its set of actions and the details of the current action.\\nMerged\\nlist_route\\nand\\ndetail_route\\ninto a single\\naction\\ndecorator.\\nGet all extra actions on a\\nViewSet\\nwith\\n.get_extra_actions()\\n.\\nExtra actions now set the\\nurl_name\\nand\\nurl_path\\non the decorated method.\\nurl_name\\nis now based on the function name, instead of the\\nurl_path\\n,\\nas the path is not always suitable (e.g., capturing arguments in the path).\\nEnable action url reversing through\\n.reverse_action()\\nmethod (added in 3.7.4)\\nExample reverse call:\\nself.reverse_action(self.custom_action.url_name)\\nAdd\\ndetail\\ninitkwarg to indicate if the current action is operating on a\\ncollection or a single instance.\\nAdditional changes:\\nDeprecated\\nlist_route\\n&\\ndetail_route\\nin favor of\\naction\\ndecorator with\\ndetail\\nboolean.\\nDeprecated dynamic list/detail route variants in favor of\\nDynamicRoute\\nwith\\ndetail\\nboolean.\\nRefactored the router's dynamic route generation.\\nlist_route\\nand\\ndetail_route\\nmaintain the old behavior of\\nurl_name\\n,\\nbasing it on the\\nurl_path\\ninstead of the function name.\\nFix formatting of the 3.7.4 release note\\n#5704\\nDocs: Update DRF Writable Nested Serializers references\\n#5711\\nDocs: Fixed typo in auth URLs example.\\n#5713\\nImprove composite field child errors\\n#5655\\nDisable HTML inputs for dict/list fields\\n#5702\\nFix typo in HostNameVersioning doc\\n#5709\\nUse rsplit to get module and classname for imports\\n#5712\\nFormalize URLPatternsTestCase\\n#5703\\nAdd exception translation test\\n#5700\\nTest staticfiles\\n#5701\\nAdd drf-yasg to documentation and schema 3rd party packages\\n#5720\\nRemove unused\\ncompat._resolve_model()\\n#5733\\nDrop compat workaround for unsupported Python 3.2\\n#5734\\nPrefer\\niter(dict)\\nover\\niter(dict.keys())\\n#5736\\nPass\\npython_requires\\nargument to setuptools\\n#5739\\nRemove unused links from docs\\n#5735\\nPrefer https protocol for links in docs when available\\n#5729\\nAdd HStoreField, postgres fields tests\\n#5654\\nAlways fully qualify ValidationError in docs\\n#5751\\nRemove unreachable code from ManualSchema\\n#5766\\nAllowed customising API documentation code samples\\n#5752\\nUpdated docs to use\\npip show\\n#5757\\nLoad 'static' instead of 'staticfiles' in templates\\n#5773\\nFixed a typo in\\nfields\\ndocs\\n#5783\\nRefer to \\\"NamespaceVersioning\\\" instead of \\\"NamespacedVersioning\\\" in the documentation\\n#5754\\nErrorDetail: add\\n__eq__\\n/\\n__ne__\\nand\\n__repr__\\n#5787\\nReplace\\nbackground-attachment: fixed\\nin docs\\n#5777\\nMake 404 & 403 responses consistent with\\nexceptions.APIException\\noutput\\n#5763\\nSmall fix to API documentation: schemas\\n#5796\\nFix schema generation for PrimaryKeyRelatedField\\n#5764\\nRepresent serializer DictField as an Object in schema\\n#5765\\nAdded docs example reimplementing ObtainAuthToken\\n#5802\\nAdd schema to the ObtainAuthToken view\\n#5676\\nFix request formdata handling\\n#5800\\nFix authtoken views imports\\n#5818\\nUpdate pytest, isort\\n#5815\\n#5817\\n#5894\\nFixed active timezone handling for non ISO8601 datetimes.\\n#5833\\nMade TemplateHTMLRenderer render IntegerField inputs when value is\\n0\\n.\\n#5834\\nCorrected endpoint in tutorial instructions\\n#5835\\nAdd Django Rest Framework Role Filters to Third party packages\\n#5809\\nUse single copy of static assets.

The network is never the bottleneck here.\\nThis problem is compounded by several factors.  One is that older/slower phones cannot always use fully-featured browsers such as Firefox for mobile.  The app is takes too many resources on its own before even opening up a website.  That means turning to a pared-down browser like Firefox Focus, which is ok except for not being able to have extensions.  That means no ublock origin, which of course makes the web an even worse experience.\\nAnother issue is that some sites will complain if you are not using a \\\"standard\\\" browser and the site will become unusable for that reason alone.\\nIn these situations, companies frequently try to force an app down your throat instead.  And who knows how much space that will take up on a space-limited device or how poorly it will run.\\nMany companies/sites used to have simplified versions to account for slower devices/connections, but in my experience these are becoming phased out and harder to find.  I imagine it's much harder to serve ads and operate a full tracking network to/from every social media company without all the javascript bloat.\\nreply\\nbboygravity\\n4 hours ago\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nEven if you do use a standard browser, companies will force you to use an app by making there website broken (on purpose?).\\nRandom recent example: Nike.

This wouldn't reduce the network and system load, however navigating the results would be much more friendly.\\nreply\\nfreedomben\\n13 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nProblem is, \\\"infinite scroll\\\" often is infinite, meaning it will load an ass load of data in the background and take up a ton of memory, and the user may never even end up looking at that data.\\nI really hate the load on scroll (especially Google Drive's implementation which is absolute trash, and half the time I'll scroll too fast and it will just miss a bunch of files and I'll have to refresh the page and try again), but a better hack might be an extension that scrolls a page or two ahead for you and stores that in memory.  If it was smart enough to infinitely scroll websites that are actually finite (like google drive) that would be amazing though.\\nreply\\njwells89\\n13 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nIn these situations what\\u2019s eating up your resources usually isn\\u2019t the data being represented but instead the representation.\\nThis is why native apps use recycler views for not just infinite scroll, but anything that can display more rows/columns/items/etc than can fit on screen at once. Recycler views only create just enough cells to fill the screen even if you have tens of thousands of items to represent, and when you scroll they reuse these cells to display the currently relevant segment of data. When used correctly by developers, these are very lightweight and allow 60FPS scrolling of very large lists even on very weak devices.\\nThese are possible to implement in JavaScript in browsers, but implementation quality varies a lot and many web devs just never bother. This is why I think HTML should gain a native recycler widget of its own, because the engineers working on Blink, Gecko, and WebKit are in much better positions to write high quality optimized implementations, plus even if web devs don\\u2019t use it directly, many frameworks will.\\nreply\\nkcrwfrd_\\n7 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nThere was a proposal for a browser-native virtual scroller:\\nhttps://wicg.github.io/virtual-scroller/\\nApparently it was abandoned (for now?) in favor of content-visibility / CSS containment primitives:\\nhttps://web.dev/articles/content-visibility\\nreply\\nSn0wCoder\\n12 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nI find this idea interesting \\u2018These are possible in JavaScript in browsers, but implementation quality varies a lot and many web devs just never bother.\\u2019\\nDo you have any examples that you consider good implementations?

Performance degradation increases with every load due to the growing number of DOM elements which eventually exceeds whatever margin is afforded by the machine the browser is running on, causing chug.\\nWeb is not my specialty so I don\\u2019t have specific recommendations, but plenty of results turn up when searching for e.g. \\u201cangular recycler\\u201d or \\u201creact recycler\\u201d.\\nreply\\nd1sxeyes\\n5 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nYou don\\u2019t actually need to load everything, just the previous, current, and next pages.\\nreply\\nthaumasiotes\\n8 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\n> Problem is, \\\"infinite scroll\\\" often is infinite, meaning it will load an ass load of data in the background and take up a ton of memory, and the user may never even end up looking at that data.\\nIt's also an infinitely worse user experience and prevents you from holding your place in whatever is being scrolled. Are there advantages? Why is infinite scroll used in any context?\\nreply\\n_flux\\n5 hours ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nPersonally I prefer infinite scroll, versus the alternative of finding the \\\"next page\\\" button at the bottom, waiting for the content to load (preloading could help here) and sometimes navigating to the beginning of actual beginning of the content I was viewing. I even used a browser extension that matched \\\"next\\\" buttons from pages and loaded the next page content automatically, but the extension (can't recall its name) is not available anymore.\\nGranted there are some downsides, such as having the browser keep extra-long pages in its memory, but overall I prefer working infinite scroll mechanisms over paged ones. As far as I see, the ability to remember the current location in the page could be easily implemented by modifying page anchor and parameters accordingly, though personally I've rarely needed it.\\nPerhaps if there was a standard way (so in the HTML spec) to implement infinite scrolling, it would work correctly in all cases and possibly even allow user to select a paged variant according to their preference.\\nNot all the paged views work correctly either. In particular systems that show threaded discussions can behave strangely when you select the next page.

It doesn't start with the developers but rather the budget. Unless folks at the top are tech savvy and/or have an engineering background, they typically only budget for new features and either under-budget or don't budget for maintenance and tech debt removal. And when they do budget for maintenance, it's handled almost exclusively by \\\"maintenance teams\\\" that are offshore and cheaper.\\nSo you have a feature team that works on a feature for 6 months, does a 1 hour \\\"KT Session\\\" with the offshore maintenance team and hands them the code. The offshore team has some information on the feature but not enough to really manage existing tech debt, just to keep the lights on. And on top of this they know they are the lowest totem on the pole and don't want to get fired so they don't go out of their way to try and fix any existing code or optimize it, again just enough to keep the thing working.\\nThen this cycle repeats 100-1000x within an org and pretty soon you have a scenario where the frontend has 2M lines of code when it really should be 250k max. A new feature team might come on with the brightest engineers and the best of intentions, but now they have to work within the box that was setup for them. Say they have a number of elements that don't line up with their feature mockups. The mockups might be incorrect, there might have been an upgrade to the UI kit, or the existing UI kit might need refactoring. Problem is none of that is budgeted for so the team is told to just copy the components and modify them for their own use. And of course on handoff to maintenance team, the new team does not want to mess with the existing feature work so they leave it as is. Management is non-technical so they don't know the difference, and you end up with 50+ components all called \\\"Button\\\" in your codebase from years and years of teams constantly copy/pasting to accommodate their new feature.\\nreply\\nkeybored\\n1 hour ago\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nThe whole point of hierarchical organizations is that those higher up have more influence than those at the lower tiers.

Even in the U.S.,\\nmany users didn't have broadband speeds\\n, making much of the web difficult to use. It's still the case that many users don't have broadband speeds, both inside and outside of the U.S. and that much of the modern web isn't usable for people with slow internet, but the exponential increase in bandwidth (Nielsen suggests\\nthis is 50% per year for high-end connections\\n) has outpaced web bloat for typical sites, making this less of a problem than it was in 2017, although it's still a serious problem for people with poor connections.\\nCPU performance for web apps hasn't scaled nearly as quickly as bandwidth so, while more of the web is becoming accessible to people with low-end connections, more of the web is becoming inaccessible to people with low-end devices even if they have high-end connections. For example, if I try browsing a \\\"modern\\\" Discourse-powered forum on a\\nTecno Spark 8C\\n, it sometimes crashes the browser. Between crashes, on measuring the performance, the responsiveness is significantly worse than browsing a BBS with an\\n8 MHz 286\\nand a\\n1200 baud\\nmodem. On my\\n1Gbps\\nhome internet connection, the\\n2.6 MB\\ncompressed payload size \\\"necessary\\\" to load message titles is relatively light. The over-the-wire payload size has \\\"only\\\" increased by\\n1000x\\n, which is dwarfed by the increase in internet speeds. But the opposite is true when it comes to CPU speeds \\u2014 for web browsing and forum loading performance, the\\n8-core (2 1.6 GHz Cortex-A75 / 6 1.6 GHz Cortex-A55)\\nCPU can't handle Discourse. The CPU is something like\\n100000x\\nfaster than our\\n286\\n. Perhaps a\\n1000000x\\nfaster device would be sufficient.\\nFor anyone not familiar with the\\nTecno Spark 8C\\n, today, a new\\nTecno Spark 8C\\n, a quick search indicates that one can be hand for\\nUSD 50-60\\nin Nigeria and perhaps\\nUSD 100-110\\nin India. As\\na fraction of median household income, that's substantially more than a current generation iPhone in the U.S. today.\\nBy worldwide standards, the\\nTecno Spark 8C\\nisn't even close to being a low-end device, so we'll also look at performance on an\\nItel P32\\n, which is a lower end device (though still far from the lowest-end device people are using today). Additionally, we'll look at performance with an\\nM3 Max Macbook (14-core)\\n, an\\nM1 Pro Macbook (8-core)\\n, and the\\nM3 Max\\nset to\\n10x\\nthrottling in Chrome dev tools. In order to give these devices every advantage, we'll be on fairly high-speed internet (1Gbps, with a WiFi router that's benchmarked as having lower latency under load than most of its peers). We'll look at some blogging platforms and micro-blogging platforms (this blog, Substack, Medium, Ghost, Hugo, Tumblr, Mastodon, Twitter, Threads, Bluesky, Patreon), forum platforms (Discourse, Reddit, Quora, vBulletin, XenForo, phpBB, and myBB), and platforms commonly used by small businesses (Wix, Squarespace, Shopify, and WordPress again).\\nIn the table below, every row represents a website and every non-label column is a metric. After the website name column, we have the compressed size transferred over the wire (\\nwire\\n) and the raw, uncompressed, size (\\nraw\\n). Then we have, for each device, Largest Contentful Paint* (\\nLCP*\\n) and CPU usage on the main thread (\\nCPU\\n). Google's docs explain\\nLCP\\nas\\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures when a user perceives that the largest content of a page is visible. The metric value for LCP represents the time duration between the user initiating the page load and the page rendering its primary content\\nLCP\\nis a common optimization target because it's presented as one of the primary metrics in Google PageSpeed Insights, a \\\"Core Web Vital\\\" metric. There's an asterisk next to\\nLCP\\nas used in this document because,\\nLCP\\nas measured by Chrome is about painting a large fraction of the screen, as opposed to the definition above, which is about content. As sites have optimized for\\nLCP\\n, it's not uncommon to have a large paint (update) that's completely useless to the user, with the actual content of the page appearing well after the\\nLCP\\n. In cases where that happens, I've used the timestamp when useful content appears, not the\\nLCP\\nas defined by when a large but useless update occurs. The full details of the tests and why these metrics were chosen are discussed in an appendix.\\nAlthough CPU time isn't a \\\"Core Web Vital\\\", it's presented here because it's a simple metric that's highly correlated with my and other users' perception of usability on slow devices. See appendix for more detailed discussion on this. One reason CPU time works as a metric is that, if a page has great numbers for all other metrics but uses a ton of CPU time, the page is not going to be usable on a slow device. If it takes 100% CPU for 30 seconds, the page will be completely unusable for 30 seconds, and if it takes 50% CPU for 60 seconds, the page will be barely usable for 60 seconds, etc. Another reason it works is that, relative to commonly used metrics, it's hard to cheat on CPU time and make optimizations that significantly move the number without impacting user experience.\\nThe color scheme in the table below is that, for sizes, more green = smaller / fast and more red = larger / slower.

When I polled folks about what platforms they thought would be fastest and slowest on our slow devices (\\nMastodon\\n,\\nTwitter\\n,\\nThreads\\n), they generally correctly predicted that Wordpress and Ghost and Wordpress would be faster than Substack and Medium, and that Discourse would be much slower than old PHP forums like phpBB, XenForo, and vBulletin. I also pulled Google PageSpeed Insights (PSI) scores for pages (not shown) and the correlation isn't as strong with those numbers\\nbecause\\na handful of sites have managed to optimize their PSI scores without actually speeding up their pages for users.\\nIf you've never used a low-end device like this, the general experience is that many sites are unusable on the device and loading anything resource intensive (an app or a huge website) can cause crashes. Doing something too intense in a resource intensive app can also cause crashes. While\\nreviews note\\nthat\\nyou can run PUBG and other 3D games with decent performance\\non a\\nTecno Spark 8C\\n, this doesn't mean that the device is fast enough to read posts on modern text-centric social media platforms or modern text-centric web forums. While\\n40fps\\nis achievable in PUBG, we can easily see less than\\n0.4fps\\nwhen scrolling on these sites.\\nWe can see from the table how many of the sites are unusable if you have a slow device. All of the pages with\\n10s+ CPU\\nare a fairly bad experience even after the page loads. Scrolling is very jerky, frequently dropping to a few frames per second and sometimes well below. When we tap on any link, the delay is so long that we can't be sure if our tap actually worked. If we tap again, we can get the dreaded situation where the first tap registers and then causes the second tap to register after things have started changing, causing us to tap some random target, but if we wait, we realize that the original tap didn't actually register (or it registered, but not where we thought it did). Although MyBB doesn't service up a mobile site and is penalized by Google for not having a mobile friendly page, it's actually much more usable on these slow mobiles than all but the fastest sites because scrolling and tapping actually work.\\nAnother thing we can see is how much variance there is in the relative performance on different devices. For example, comparing an\\nM3/10\\nand a\\nTecno Spark 8C\\n, for danluu.com and Ghost, an\\nM3/10\\ngives a halfway decent approximation of the\\nTecno Spark 8C\\n(although danluu.com loads much too quickly), but the\\nTecno Spark 8C\\nis about three times slower (\\nCPU\\n) for Medium, Substack, and Twitter, roughly four times slower for Reddit and Discourse, and over an order of magnitude faster for Shopify. For Wix, the\\nCPU\\napproximation is about accurate, but our `\\nTecno Spark 8C\\nis more than 3 times slower on\\nLCP*\\n. It's great that Chrome lets you conveniently simulate a slower device from the convenience of your computer, but just enabling Chrome's CPU throttling (or using any combination of out-of-the-box options that are available) gives fairly different results than we get on many real devices. The full reasons for this are beyond the scope of the post; for the purposes of this post, it's sufficient to note that slow pages are often super-linearly slow as devices get slower and that slowness on one page doesn't strongly predict slowness on another page.\\nIf take a site-centric view instead of a device-centric view, another way to look at it is that sites like Discourse, Medium, and Reddit, don't use all that much CPU on our fast\\nM3\\nand\\nM1\\ncomputers, but they're among the slowest on our\\nTecno Spark 8C\\n(Reddit's CPU is shown as\\n\\u221e\\nbecause, no matter how long we wait with no interaction, Reddit uses\\n~90% CPU\\n). Discourse also sometimes crashed the browser after interacting a bit or just waiting a while. For example, one time, the browser crashed after loading Discourse, scrolling twice, and then leaving the device still for a minute or two. For consistency's sake, this wasn't marked as\\nFAIL\\nin the table since the page did load but, realistically, having a page is so resource intensive that the browser crashes is a significantly worse user experience than any of the\\nFAIL\\ncases in the table. When we looked at how\\nweb bloat impacts users with slow connections\\n, we found that\\nmuch of the web was unusable for people with slow connections and slow devices are no different\\n.\\nAnother pattern we can see is how the older sites are, in general, faster than the newer ones, with sites that (visually) look like they haven't been updated in a decade or two tending to be among the fastest. For example, MyBB, the least modernized and oldest looking forum is\\n3.6x / 5x faster (LCP* / CPU)\\nthan Discourse on the\\nM3\\n, but on the\\nTecno Spark 8C\\n, the difference is\\n19x / 33x\\nand, given the overall scaling, it seems safe to guess that the difference would be even larger on the Itel P32 if Discourse worked on such a cheap device.\\nAnother example is Wordpress (old) vs. newer, trendier, blogging platforms like Medium and Substack. Wordpress (old) is is\\n17.5x / 10x faster (LCP* / CPU)\\nthan Medium and\\n5x / 7x faster (LCP* / CPU)\\nfaster than Substack on our\\nM3 Max\\n, and\\n4x / 19x\\nand\\n20x / 8x\\nfaster, respectively, on our\\nTecno Spark 8C\\n. Ghost is a notable exception to this, being a modern platform (launched a year after Medium) that's competitive with older platforms (modern Wordpress is also arguably an exception, but many folks would probably still consider that to be an old platform).\\nSites that use modern techniques like partially loading the page and then dynamically loading the rest of it, such as Discourse, Reddit, and Substack, tend to be less usable than the scores in the table indicate. Although, in principle, you could build such a site in a simple way that works well with cheap devices but, in practice sites that use dynamic loading tend to be complex enough that the sites are extremely janky on low-end devices. It's generally difficult or impossible to scroll a predictable distance, which means that users will sometimes accidentally trigger more loading by scrolling too far, causing the page to lock up. Many pages actually remove the parts of the page you scrolled past as you scroll; all such pages are essentially unusable. Other basic web features, like page search, also generally stop working. Pages with this kind of dynamic loading can't rely on the simple and fast ctrl/command+F search and have to build their own search. How well this works varies (this used to work quite well in Google docs, but for the past few months or maybe a year, it takes so long to load that I have to deliberately wait after opening a doc to avoid triggering the browser's useless built in search; Discourse search has never really worked on slow devices or even not very fast but not particular slow devices).\\nIn principle, these modern pages that burn a ton of CPU when loading could be doing pre-work that means that later interactions on the page are faster and cheaper than on the pages that do less up-front work (this is a common argument in favor of these kinds of pages), but that's not the case for pages tested, which are slower to load initially, slower on subsequent loads, and slower after they've loaded.\\nTo understand why the theoretical idea that doing all this work up-front doesn't generally result in a faster experience later, this exchange between a distinguished engineer at Google and one of the founders of Discourse (and CEO at the time) is\\nillustrative\\n, in\\na discussion where the founder of Discourse says that you should test mobile sites on laptops with throttled bandwidth but not throttled CPU\\n:\\nGoogle\\n: *you* also don't have slow 3G. These two settings go together. Empathy needs to extend beyond iPhone XS users in a tunnel.\\nDiscourse\\n: Literally any phone of vintage iPhone 6 or greater is basically as fast as the \\\"average\\\" laptop. You have to understand how brutally bad Qualcomm is at their job. Look it up if you don't believe me.\\nGoogle\\n: I don't need to believe you. I know. This is well known by people who care. My point was that just like not everyone has a fast connection not everyone has a fast phone. Certainly the iPhone 6 is frequently very CPU bound on real world websites. But that isn't the point.\\nDiscourse\\n: we've been trending towards infinite CPU speed for decades now (and we've been asymptotically there for ~5 years on desktop), what we are not and will never trend towards is infinite bandwidth. Optimize for the things that matter. and I have zero empathy for @qualcomm. Fuck Qualcomm, they're terrible at their jobs. I hope they go out of business and the ground their company existed on is plowed with salt so nothing can ever grow there again.\\nGoogle\\n: Mobile devices are not at all bandwidth constraint in most circumstances. They are latency constraint. Even the latest iPhone is CPU constraint before it is bandwidth constraint. If you do well on 4x slow down on a MBP things are pretty alright\\n...\\nGoogle\\n: Are 100% of users on iOS?\\nDiscourse\\n: The influential users who spend money tend to be, I\\u2019ll tell you that ... Pointless to worry about cpu, it is effectively infinite already on iOS, and even with Qualcomm\\u2019s incompetence, will be within 4 more years on their embarrassing SoCs as well\\nWhen someone asks the founder of Discourse, \\\"just wondering why you hate them\\\", he responds with a link that cites the Kraken and Octane benchmarks from\\nthis Anandtech review\\n, which have the Qualcomm chip at 74% and 85% of the performance of the then-current Apple chip, respectively.\\nThe founder and then-CEO of Discourse considers Qualcomm's mobile performance embarrassing and finds this so offensive that he thinks Qualcomm engineers should all lose their jobs for delivering\\n74% to 85% of the performance of Apple\\n. Apple has what I consider to be an all-time great performance team. Reasonable people could disagree on that, but one has to at least think of them as a world-class team. So, producing a product with\\n74% to 85% of an all-time-great team is considered an embarrassment worthy of losing your job\\n.\\nThere are two attitudes on display here which I see in a lot of software folks. First, that CPU speed is infinite and one shouldn't worry about CPU optimization. And second, that gigantic speedups from hardware should be expected and the only reason hardware engineers wouldn't achieve them is due to spectacular incompetence, so the slow software should be blamed on hardware engineers, not software engineers. Donald Knuth expressed a similar sentiment in\\nI might as well flame a bit about my personal unhappiness with the current trend toward multicore architecture. To me, it looks more or less like the hardware designers have run out of ideas, and that they\\u2019re trying to pass the blame for the future demise of Moore\\u2019s Law to the software writers by giving us machines that work faster only on a few key benchmarks! I won\\u2019t be surprised at all if the whole multiithreading idea turns out to be a flop, worse than the \\\"Itanium\\\" approach that was supposed to be so terrific\\u2014until it turned out that the wished-for compilers were basically impossible to write. Let me put it this way: During the past 50 years, I\\u2019ve written well over a thousand programs, many of which have substantial size. I can\\u2019t think of even five of those programs that would have been enhanced noticeably by parallelism or multithreading. Surely, for example, multiple processors are no help to TeX ... I know that important applications for parallelism exist\\u2014rendering graphics, breaking codes, scanning images, simulating physical and biological processes, etc. But all these applications require dedicated code and special-purpose techniques, which will need to be changed substantially every few years. Even if I knew enough about such methods to write about them in TAOCP, my time would be largely wasted, because soon there would be little reason for anybody to read those parts ... The machine I use today has dual processors. I get to use them both only when I\\u2019m running two independent jobs at the same time; that\\u2019s nice, but it happens only a few minutes every week.\\nIn the case of Discourse, a hardware engineer is an embarrassment not deserving of a job if they can't hit 90% of the performance of an all-time-great performance team but, as a software engineer, delivering 3% the performance of a non-highly-optimized application like MyBB is no problem. In Knuth's case,\\nhardware engineers\\ngave programmers a 100x performance increase every decade for decades with little to no work on the part of programmers. The moment this slowed down and programmers had to adapt to take advantage of new hardware, hardware engineers were \\\"all out of ideas\\\", but learning a few \\\"new\\\" (1970s and 1980s era) ideas to take advantage of current hardware would be a waste of time. And\\nwe've previously discussed Alan Kay's claim that hardware engineers are \\\"unsophisticated\\\" and \\\"uneducated\\\" and aren't doing \\\"real engineering\\\" and how we'd get a 1000x speedup if we listened to Alan Kay's \\\"sophisticated\\\" ideas\\n.\\nIt's fairly common for programmers to expect that hardware will solve all their problems, and then, when that doesn't happen, pass the issue onto the user, explaining why the programmer needn't do anything to help the user. A question one might ask is how much performance improvement programmers have given us. There are cases of algorithmic improvements that result in massive speedups but, as we noted above, Discourse, the fastest growing forum software today, seems to have given us an approximately\\n1000000x\\nslowdown in performance.\\nAnother common attitude on display above is the idea that users who aren't wealthy don't matter. When asked if 100% of users are on iOS, the founder of Discourse says \\\"The influential users who spend money tend to be, I\\u2019ll tell you that\\\". We see the same attitude all over comments on\\nTonsky's JavaScript Bloat post\\n, with people expressing\\ncocktail-party sentiments\\nlike \\\"Phone apps are hundreds of megs, why are we obsessing over web apps that are a few megs? Starving children in Africa can download Android apps but not web apps? Come on and \\\"surely no user of gitlab would be poor enough to have a slow device, let's be serious\\\" (paraphrased for length).\\nBut when we look at the size of apps that are downloaded in Africa, we see that people who aren't on high-end devices use apps like Facebook Lite (a couple megs) and commonly use apps that are a single digit to low double digit number of megabytes. There are multiple reasons app makers care about their app size. One is just the total storage available on the phone; if you watch real users install apps, they often have to delete and uninstall things to put a new app on, so the smaller size is both easier to to install and has a lower chance of being uninstalled when the user is looking for more space. Another is that, if you look at data on app size and usage (I don't know of any public data on this; please pass it along if you have something public I can reference), when large apps increase the size and memory usage, they get more crashes, which drives down user retention, growth, and engagement and, conversely, when they optimize their size and memory usage, they get fewer crashes and better user retention, growth, and engagement.\\nOn the bit about no programmers having slow devices, I know plenty of people who are using hand-me-down devices that are old and slow. Many of them aren't even really poor; they just don't see why (for example) their kid needs a super fast device, and they don't understand how much of the modern web works poorly on slow devices. After all, the \\\"slow\\\" device can play 3d games and (with the right OS) compile codebases like Linux or Chromium, so why shouldn't the device be able to interact with a site like gitlab?\\nContrary to the claim from the founder of Discourse that, within years, every Android user will be on some kind of super fast Android device, it's been six years since his comment and it's going to be at least a decade before almost everyone in the world who's using a phone has a high-speed device and this could easily take two decades or more. If you look up marketshare stats for Discourse, it's extremely successful; it appears to be the fastest growing forum software in the world by a large margin. The impact of having the fastest growing forum software in the world created by an organization whose then-leader was willing to state that he doesn't really care about users who aren't \\\"influential users who spend money\\\", who don't have access to \\\"infinite CPU speed\\\", is that a lot of forums are now inaccessible to people who don't have enough wealth to buy a device with effectively infinite CPU.\\nIf the founder of Discourse were an anomaly, this wouldn't be too much of a problem, but he's just verbalizing the implicit assumptions a lot of programmers have, which is why we see that so many modern websites are unusable if you buy the income-adjusted equivalent of a new, current generation, iPhone in a low-income country.\\nThanks to Yossi Kreinen, Fabian Giesen, John O'Nolan, Joseph Scott, Loren McIntyre, @acidshill, Alex Russell, Tobias Marschner, Matt Stuchlik, @gekitsu@toot.cat, and David Turner for comments/corrections/discussion.\\nAppendix: gaming LCP\\nWe noted above that we used\\nLCP*\\nand not\\nLCP\\n. This is because\\nLCP\\nbasically measures when the largest change happens. When this metric was not deliberately gamed in ways that don't benefit the user, this was a great metric, but this metric has become less representative of the actual user experience as more people have gamed it. In the less blatant cases, people do small optimizations that improve\\nLCP\\nbut barely improve or don't improve the actual user experience.\\nIn the more blatant cases, developers will deliberately flash a very large change on the page as soon as possible, generally a loading screen that has no value to the user (actually negative value because doing this increases the total amount of work done and the total time it takes to load the page) and then they carefully avoid making any change large enough that any later change would get marked as the\\nLCP\\n.\\nFor the same reason\\nthat VW didn't publicly discuss how it was gaming its emissions numbers\\n, developers tend to shy away from discussing this kind of\\nLCP\\noptimization in public. An exception to this is Discourse, where\\nthey publicly announced this kind of\\nLCP\\noptimization, with comments from their devs and the then-CTO (now CEO)\\n, noting that their new \\\"Discourse Splash\\\" feature hugely reduced\\nLCP\\nfor sites after they deployed it. And then developers ask why their\\nLCP\\nis high, the standard advice from Discourse developers is to keep elements smaller than the \\\"Discourse Splash\\\", so that the\\nLCP\\ntimestamp is computed from this useless element that's thrown up to optimize\\nLCP\\n, as opposed to having the timestamp be computed from any actual element that's relevant to the user.\\nHere's a typical, official, comment from Discourse\\nIf your banner is larger than the element we use for the \\\"Introducing Discourse Splash - A visual preloader displayed while site assets load\\\" you gonna have a bad time for LCP.\\nThe official response from Discourse is that you should make sure that your content doesn't trigger the\\nLCP\\nmeasurement and that, instead, our loading animation timestamp is what's used to compute `LCP.\\nThe sites with the most extreme ratio of\\nLCP\\nof useful content vs. Chrome's measured\\nLCP\\nwere:\\nWix\\nM3\\n:\\n6\\nM1\\n:\\n12\\nTecno Spark 8C\\n:\\n3\\nItel P32\\n:\\nN/A\\n(FAIL)\\nDiscourse:\\nM3\\n:\\n10\\nM1\\n:\\n12\\nTecno Spark 8C\\n:\\n4\\nItel P32\\n:\\nN/A\\n(FAIL)\\nAlthough we haven't discussed the gaming of other metrics, it appears that some websites also game other metrics and \\\"optimize\\\" them even when this has no benefit to users.\\nAppendix: the selfish argument for optimizing sites\\nThis will depend on the scale of the site as well as its performance, but when I've looked at this data for large companies I've worked for, improving site and app performance is worth a mind boggling amount of money. It's measurable in A/B tests and it's also among the interventions that has, in long-term holdbacks, a relatively large impact on growth and retention (many interventions test well but don't look as good long term, whereas performance improvements tend to look better long term).\\nOf course you can see this from the direct numbers, but you can also implicitly see this in a lot of ways when looking at the data. One angle is that (just for example), at Twitter, user-observed p99 latency was about\\n60s\\nin India as well as a number of African countries (even excluding relatively wealthy ones like Egypt and South Africa) and also about\\n60s\\nin the United States. Of course, across the entire population, people have faster devices and connections in the United States, but in every country, there are enough users that have slow devices or connections that the limiting factor is really user patience and not the underlying population-level distribution of devices and connections. Even if you don't care about users in Nigeria or India and only care about U.S. ad revenue, improving performance for low-end devices and connections has enough of impact that we could easily see the impact in global as well as U.S. revenue in A/B tests, especially in long-term holdbacks. And you also see the impact among users who have fast devices since a change that improves the latency for a user with a \\\"low-end\\\" device from\\n60s\\nto\\n50s\\nmight improve the latency for a user with a high-end device from\\n5s\\nto\\n4.5s\\n, which has an impact on revenue, growth, and retention numbers as well.\\nFor\\na variety of reasons that are beyond the scope of this doc\\n, this kind of boring, quantifiable, growth and revenue driving work has been difficult to get funded at most large companies I've worked for relative to flash product work that ends up showing little to no impact in long-term holdbacks.\\nAppendix: designing for low performance devices\\nWhen using slow devices or any device with low bandwidth and/or poor connectivity, the best experiences, by far, are generally the ones that load a lot of content at once into a static page. If the images have proper width and height attributes and alt text, that's very helpful. Progressive images (as in progressive jpeg) isn't particularly helpful.\\nOn a slow device with high bandwidth, any lightweight, static, page works well, and lightweight dynamic pages can work well if designed for performance. Heavy, dynamic, pages are doomed unless the page weight doesn't cause the page to be complex.\\nWith low bandwidth and/or poor connectivity, lightweight pages are fine. With heavy pages, the best experience I've had is when I trigger a page load, go do something else, and then come back when it's done (or at least the HTML and CSS are done). I can then open each link I might want to read in a new tab, and then do something else while I wait for those to load.\\nA lot of the optimizations that modern websites do, such as partial loading that causes more loading when you scroll down the page, and the concomitant hijacking of search (because the browser's built in search is useless if the page isn't fully loaded) causes the interaction model that works to stop working and makes pages very painful to interact with.\\nJust for example, a number of people have noted that Substack performs poorly for them because it does partial page loads.\\nHere's a video by @acidshill of what it looks like to load a Substack article and then scroll on an iPhone 8\\n, where the post has a fairly fast\\nLCP\\n, but if you want to scroll past the header, you have to wait\\n6s\\nfor the next page to load, and then on scrolling again, you have to wait maybe another\\n1s\\nto\\n2s\\n:\\nAs an example of the opposite approach, I tried loading some fairly large plain HTML pages, such as\\nhttps://danluu.com/diseconomies-scale/\\n(\\n0.1 MB wire\\n/\\n0.4 MB raw\\n) and\\nhttps://danluu.com/threads-faq/\\n(\\n0.4 MB wire\\n/\\n1.1 MB raw\\n) and these were still quite usable for me even on slow devices.\\n1.1 MB\\nseems to be larger than optimal and breaking that into a few different pages would be better on a low-end devices, but a single page with\\n1.1 MB\\nof text works much better than most modern sites on a slow device. While you can get into trouble with HTML pages that are so large that browsers can't really handle them, for pages with a normal amount of content, it generally isn't until you have\\ncomplex CSS payloads\\nor JS that the pages start causing problems for slow devices. Below, we test pages that are relatively simple, some of which have a fair amount of media (\\n14 MB\\nin one case) and find that these pages work ok, as long as they stay simple.\\nAppendix: articles on web performance issues\\n2015: Maciej Ceg\\u0142owski:\\nThe Website Obesity Crisis\\nSize:\\n1.0 MB\\n/\\n1.1 MB\\nTecno Spark 8C\\n:\\n0.9s\\n/\\n1.4s\\nScrolling a bit jerky, images take a little bit of time to appear if scrolling very quickly (jumping halfway down page from top), but delay is below what almost any user would perceive when scrolling a normal distance.\\n2015: Nate Berkopec:\\nPage Weight Doesn't Matter\\nSize:\\n80 kB\\n/\\n0.2 MB\\nTecno Spark 8C\\n:\\n0.8s\\n/\\n0.7s\\nDoes lazy loading, page downloads\\n650 kB\\n/\\n1.8 MB\\nif you scroll through the entire page, but scrolling is only a little jerk and the lazy loading doesn't cause delays.

By hate mail, I don't mean polite suggestions to change things, I mean the equivalent of road rage, but for web browsing; web rage. I know people who run sites that are complex enough that they're unusable by a significant fraction of people in the world. How come people are so incensed about the styling of this site and, proportionally, basically don't care at all that the web is unusable for so many people?\\nAnother funny thing here is that the people who appreciate the styling generally appreciate that the site doesn't override any kind of default styling, letting you make the width exactly what you want (by setting your window size how you want it) and it also doesn't override any kind of default styling you apply to sites. The people who are really insistent about this want everyone to have some width limit they prefer, some font they prefer, etc., but it's always framed in a way as if they don't want it, it's really for the benefit of people at large even though accommodating the preferences of the web ragers would directly oppose the preferences of people who prefer (just for example) to be able to adjust the text width by adjusting their window width.\\nUntil I pointed this out tens of times, this iteration would usually start with web ragers telling me that \\\"studies show\\\" that narrower text width is objectively better, but on reading every study that exists on the topic that I could find, I didn't find this to be the case. Moreover, on asking for citations, it's clear that people saying this generally hadn't read any studies on this at all and would sometimes hastily send me a study that they did not seem to have read. When I'd point this out, people would then change their argument to how studies can't really describe the issue (odd that they'd cite studies in the first place), although one person cited a book to me (which I read and they, apparently, had not since it also didn't support their argument) and then move to how this is what everyone wants, even though that's clearly not the case, both from the comments I've gotten as well as the data I have from when I made the change.\\nWeb ragers who have this line of reasoning generally can't seem to absorb the information that their preferences are not universal and will insist that they regardless of what people say they like, which I find fairly interesting. On the data, when I switched from Octopress styling (at the time, the most popular styling for programming bloggers) to the current styling, I got what appeared to be a causal an increase in traffic and engagement, so it appears that not only do people who write me appreciation mail about the styling like the styling, the overall feeling of people who don't write to me appears to be that the site is fine and apparently more appealing than standard programmer blog styling. When I've noted this, people either become further invested in the idea that their preferences are universal and people who think they have other preferences are wrong and reply with total nonsense.\\nI would understand this kind of anger about how much the web has been made unusable for people who aren't, by global standards, fairly well off, but it's curious that so many people find a site that is accessible but accedes to other people's preferences to be a topic worth sending so many angry rants about, as well as one where it's worth fabricating \\\"objective\\\" evidence for their opinion.\\nAppendix: empathy for non-rich users\\nSomething I've observed over time, as programming has become more prestigious and more lucrative, is\\nthat people have tended to come from wealthier backgrounds\\nand have less exposure to people with different income levels. An example we've discussed before, is at a well-known, prestigious, startup that has a very left-leaning employee base, where everyone got rich, on a discussion about the covid stimulus checks, in a slack discussion, a well meaning progressive employee said that it was pointless because people would just use their stimulus checks to buy stock. This person had, apparently, never talked to any middle-class (let alone poor) person about where their money goes or looked at the data on who owns equity. And that's just looking at American wealth. When we look at world-wide wealth, the general level of understanding is much lower. People seem to really underestimate the dynamic range in wealth and income across the world. From having talked to quite a few people about this, a lot of people seem to have mental buckets for \\\"poor by American standards\\\" (buys stock with stimulus checks) and \\\"poor by worldwide standards\\\" (maybe doesn't even buy stock), but the range of poverty in the world dwarfs the range of poverty in America to an extent that not many wealthy programmers seem to realize.\\nJust for example,\\nin this discussion how lucky I was (in terms of financial opportunities) that my parents made it to America\\n, someone mentioned that it's not that big a deal because they had great financial opportunities in Poland. For one thing, with respect to the topic of the discussion, the probability that someone will end up with a high-paying programming job (senior staff eng at a high-paying tech company) or equivalent, I suspect that, when I was born, being born poor in the U.S. gives you better odds than being fairly well off in Poland, but I could believe the other case as well if presented with data. But if we're comparing Poland v. U.S. to Vietnam v. U.S., if I spend\\n15 seconds looking up rough wealth numbers for these countries\\nin the year I was born, the GDP/capita ratio of U.S. : Poland was ~8:1, whereas it was ~50 : 1 for Poland : Vietnam. The difference in wealth between Poland and Vietnam was roughly the square of the difference between the U.S. and Poland, so Poland to Vietnam is roughly equivalent to Poland vs. some hypothetical country that's richer than the U.S. by the amount that the U.S. is richer than Poland. These aren't even remotely comparable, but a lot of people seem to have this mental model that there's \\\"rich countries\\\" and \\\"not rich countries\\\" and \\\"not rich countries\\\" are all roughly in the same bucket. GDP/capita isn't ideal, but it's easier to find than percentile income statistics; the quick search I did also turned up that annual income in Vietnam then was something like $200-$300 a year. Vietnam was also going through the tail end of a famine whose impacts are a bit difficult to determine because statistics here seem to be gamed, but if you believe the mortality rate statistics, the famine caused total overall mortality rate to jump to double the normal baseline\\n1\\n.\\nOf course, at the time, the median person in a low-income country wouldn't have had a computer, let alone internet access. But, today it's fairly common for people in low-income countries to have devices. Many people either don't seem to realize this or don't understand what sorts of devices a lot of these folks use.\\nAppendix: comments from Fabian Giesen\\nOn the Discourse founder's comments on iOS vs. Android marketshare, Fabian notes\\nIn the US, according to the most recent data I could find (for 2023), iPhones have around 60% marketshare. In the EU, it's around 33%. This has knock-on effects. Not only do iOS users skew towards the wealthier end, they also skew towards the US.\\nThere's some secondary effects from this too. For example, in the US, iMessage is very popular for group chats etc. and infamous for interoperating very poorly with Android devices in a way that makes the experience for Android users very annoying (almost certainly intentionally so).\\nIn the EU, not least because Android is so much more prominent, iMessage is way less popular and anecdotally, even iPhone users among my acquaintances who would probably use iMessage in the US tend to use WhatsApp instead.\\nPoint being, globally speaking, recent iOS + fast Internet is even more skewed towards a particular demographic than many app devs in the US seem to be aware.\\nAnd on the comment about mobile app vs. web app sizes, Fabian said:\\nOne more note from experience: apps you install when you install them, and generally have some opportunity to hold off on updates while you're on a slow or metered connection (or just don't have data at all).\\nBack when I originally got my US phone, I had no US credit history and thus had to use prepaid plans. I still do because it's fine for what I actually use my phone for most of the time, but it does mean that when I travel to Germany once a year, I don't get data roaming at all. (Also, phone calls in Germany cost me $1.50 apiece, even though T-Mobile is the biggest mobile provider in Germany - though, of course, not T-Mobile US.)\\nPoint being, I do get access to free and fast Wi-Fi at T-Mobile hotspots (e.g. major train stations, airports etc.) and on inter-city trains that have them, but I effectively don't have any data plan when in Germany at all.\\nThis is completely fine with mobile phone apps that work offline and sync their data when they have a connection. But web apps are unusable while I'm not near a public Wi-Fi.\\nLikewise I'm fine sending an email over a slow metered connection via the Gmail app, but I for sure wouldn't use any web-mail client that needs to download a few MBs worth of zipped JS to do anything on a metered connection.\\nAt least with native app downloads, I can prepare in advance and download them while I'm somewhere with good internet!\\nAnother comment from Fabian (this time paraphrased since this was from a conversation), is that people will often justify being quantitatively hugely slower because there's a qualitative reason something should be slow. One example he gave was that screens often take a long time to sync their connection and this is justified because there are operations that have to be done that take time. For a long time, these operations would often take seconds. Recently, a lot of displays sync much more quickly because Nvidia specifies how long this can take for something to be \\\"G-Sync\\\" certified, so display makers actually do this in a reasonable amount of time now. While it's true that there are operations that have to be done that take time, there's no fundamental reason they should take as much time as they often used to. Another example he gave was on how someone was justifying how long it took to read thousands of files because the operation required a lot of syscalls and \\\"syscalls are slow\\\", which is a qualitatively true statement, but if you look at the actual cost of a syscall, in the case under discussion, the cost of a syscall was many orders of magnitude from being costly enough to be a reasonable explanation for why it took so long to read thousands of files.\\nOn this topic, when people point out that a modern website is slow, someone will generally respond with the qualitative defense that the modern website has these great features, which the older website is lacking. And while it's true that (for example) Discourse has features that MyBB doesn't, it's hard to argue that its feature set justifies being\\n33x\\nslower.\\nAppendix: experimental details\\nWith the exception of danluu.com and, arguably, HN, for each site, I tried to find the \\\"most default\\\" experience. For example, for WordPress, this meant a demo blog with the current default theme, twentytwentyfour. In some cases, this may not be the most likely thing someone uses today, e.g., for Shopify, I looked at the first thing that theme they give you when you browse their themes, but I didn't attempt to find theme data to see what the most commonly used theme is. For this post, I wanted to do all of the data collection and analysis as a short project, something that takes less than a day, so there were a number of shortcuts like this, which will be described below. I don't think it's wrong to use the first-presented Shopify theme in a decent fraction of users will probably use the first-presente theme, but that is, of course, less representative than grabbing whatever the most common theme is and then also testing many different sites that use that theme to see how real-world performance varies when people modify the theme for their own use. If I worked for Shopify or wanted to do competitive analysis on behalf of a competitor, I would do that, but for a one-day project on how large websites impact users on low-end devices, the performance of Shopify demonstrated here seems ok.\\nFor the tests on laptops, I tried to have the laptop at ~60% battery, not plugged in, and the laptop was idle for enough time to return to thermal equilibrium in a room at 20\\u00b0C, so pages shouldn't be impacted by prior page loads or other prior work that was happening on the machine.\\nFor the mobile tests, the phones were at ~100% charge and plugged in, and also previously at 100% charge so the phones didn't have any heating effect you can get from rapidly charging. As noted above, these tests were formed with\\n1Gbps\\nWiFi. No other apps were running, the browser had no other tabs open, and the only apps that were installed on the device, so no additional background tasks should've been running other than whatever users are normally subject to by the device by default. A real user with the same device is going to see worse performance than we measured here in almost every circumstance.\\nSizes were all measured on mobile, so in cases where different assets are loaded on mobile vs. desktop, the we measured the mobile asset sizes.\\nCPU\\nwas measured as CPU time on the main thread (I did also record time on other threads for sites that used other threads, but didn't use this number; if\\nCPU\\nwere a metric people wanted to game, time on other threads would have to be accounted for to prevent sites from trying to offload as much work as possible to other threads, but this isn't currently an issue and time on main thread is more directly correlated to usability than sum of time across all threads, and the metric that would work for gaming is less legible with no upside for now).\\nFor WiFi speeds, speed tests had the following numbers:\\nM3 Max\\nNetflix (fast.com)\\nDownload:\\n850 Mbps\\nUpload:\\n840 Mbps\\nLatency (unloaded / loaded):\\n3ms\\n/\\n8ms\\nOkta\\nDownload:\\n900 Mbps\\nUpload:\\n840 Mbps\\nLatency (unloaded / download / upload):\\n3ms\\n/\\n8ms\\n/\\n13ms\\nTecno Spark 8C\\nNetflix (fast.com)\\nDownload:\\n390 Mbps\\nUpload:\\n210 Mbps\\nLatency (unloaded / loaded):\\n2ms\\n/\\n30ms\\nOkta\\nOkta web app fails, can't see results\\nItel P32\\nNetflix\\nDownload:\\n44 Mbps\\nUpload: test fails to work (sends one chunk of data and then hangs, sending no more data)\\nLatency (unloaded / loaded):\\n4ms\\n/\\n400ms\\nOkta\\nDownload:\\n45 Mbps\\nUpload: test fails to work\\nLatency: test fails to display latency\\nOne thing to note is that the\\nItel P32\\ndoesn't really have the ability to use the bandwidth that it nominally has. Looking at the top Google reviews, none of them mention this.\\nThe first review reads\\nPerformance-wise, the phone doesn\\u2019t lag. It is powered by the latest Android 8.1 (GO Edition) ... we have 8GB+1GB ROM and RAM, to run on a power horse of 1.3GHz quad-core processor for easy multi-tasking ... I\\u2019m impressed with the features on the P32, especially because of the price. I would recommend it for those who are always on the move. And for those who take battery life in smartphones has their number one priority, then P32 is your best bet.\\nThe second review reads\\nItel mobile is one of the leading Africa distributors ranking 3rd on a continental scale ... the light operating system acted up to our expectations with no sluggish performance on a 1GB RAM device ... fairly fast processing speeds ... the Itel P32 smartphone delivers the best performance beyond its capabilities ... at a whooping UGX 330,000 price tag, the Itel P32 is one of those amazing low-range like smartphones that deserve a mid-range flag for amazing features embedded in a single package.\\nThe third review reads\\n\\\"Much More Than Just a Budget Entry-Level Smartphone ... Our full review after 2 weeks of usage ... While switching between apps, and browsing through heavy web pages, the performance was optimal. There were few lags when multiple apps were running in the background, while playing games. However, the overall performance is average for maximum phone users, and is best for average users [screenshot of game] Even though the game was skipping some frames, and automatically dropped graphical details it was much faster if no other app was running on the phone.\\nNotes on sites:\\nWix\\nwww.wix.com/website-template/view/html/3173?originUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fwebsite%2Ftemplates%2Fhtml%2Fmost-popular&tpClick=view_button&esi=a30e7086-28db-4e2e-ba22-9d1ecfbb1250: this was the first entry when I clicked to get a theme\\nLCP\\nwas misleading on every device\\nOn the\\nTecno Spark 8C\\n, scrolling never really works.

The thing that's incorrect is that profile photos have a square box around then\\nHowever, as with the other heavy pages, interacting with the page doesn't really work and the page is unusable, but this appears to be for the standard performance reasons and not because the page failed to render\\nTwitter\\ntwitter.com/danluu: used my profile where possible\\nDiscourse\\nmeta.discourse.org: this is what turned up when I searched for an official forum.\\nAs discussed above, the\\nLCP\\nis highly gamed and basically meaningless. We linked to a post where the Discourse folks note that, on slow loads, they put a giant splash screen up at\\n2s\\nto cap the\\nLCP\\nat\\n2s\\n. Also notable is that, on loads that are faster than the 2s, the\\nLCP\\nis also highly gamed. For example, on the\\nM3 Max\\nwith low-latency\\n1Gbps\\ninternet, the\\nLCP\\nwas reported as\\n115ms\\n, but the page loads actual content at\\n1.1s\\n. This appears to use the same fundamental trick as \\\"Discourse Splash\\\", in that it paints a huge change onto the screen and then carefully loads smaller elements to avoid having the actual page content detected as the\\nLCP\\n.\\nOn the\\nTecno Spark 8C\\n, scrolling is unpredictable and can jump too far, triggering loading from infinite scroll, which hangs the page for\\n3s-10s\\n. Also, the entire browser sometimes crashes if you just let the browser sit on this page for a while.\\nOn the\\nItel P32\\n, an error message is displayed after\\n7.5s\\nBluesky\\nbsky.app/profile/danluu.com\\nDisplays a blank screen on the\\nItel P32\\nSquarespace\\ncedar-fluid-demo.squarespace.com: this was the second theme that showed up when I clicked themes to get a theme; the first was one called \\\"Bogart\\\", but that was basically a \\\"coming soon\\\" single page screen with no content, so I used the second theme instead of the first one.\\nA lot of errors and warnings in the console with the\\nItel P32\\n, but the page appears to load and work, although interacting with it is fairly slow and painful\\nLCP\\non the\\nTecno Spark 8C\\nwas significantly before the page content actually loaded\\nTumblr\\nwww.tumblr.com/slatestarscratchpad: used this because I know this tubmlr exists.

The console shows that the JavaScript errors out, but the page still works fine (I tried scrolling, clicking links, etc., and these all worked), so you can actually go to the post you want and read it. The JS error appears to have made this page load much more quickly than it other would have and also made interacting with the page after it loaded fairly zippy.\\nShopify\\nthemes.shopify.com/themes/motion/styles/classic/preview?surface_detail=listing&surface_inter_position=1&surface_intra_position=1&surface_type=all: this was the first theme that showed up when I looked for themes\\nOn the first\\nM3/10\\nrun, Chrome dev tools reported a nonsensical\\n697s\\nof CPU time (the run completed in a normal amount of time, well under\\n697s\\nor even\\n697/10s\\n. This run was ignored when computing results.\\nOn the\\nItel P32\\n, the page load never completes and it just shows a flashing cursor-like image, which is deliberately loaded by the theme. On devices that load properly, the flashing cursor image is immediately covered up by another image, but that never happens here.\\nI wondered if it wasn't fair to use this example theme because there's some stuff on the page that lets you switch theme styles, so I checked out actual uses of the theme (the page that advertises the theme lists users of the theme). I tried the first two listed real examples and they were both much slower than this demo page.\\nReddit\\nreddit.com\\nHas an unusually low\\nLCP*\\ncompared to how long it takes for the page to become usable. Although not measured in this test, I generally find the page slow and sort of unusable on Intel Macbooks which are, by historical standards, extremely fast computers (unless I use old.reddit.com)\\nMastodon\\nmastodon.social/@danluu: used my profile where possible\\nFails to load on\\nItel P32\\n, just gives you a blank screen. Due to how long things generally take on the\\nItel P32\\n, it's not obvious for a while if the page is failing or if it's just slow\\nQuora\\nwww.quora.com/Ever-felt-like-giving-up-on-your-dreams-How-did-you-come-out-of-it: I tried googling for quora + the username of a metafilter user who I've heard is now prolific on Quora. Rather than giving their profile page, Google returned this page, which appears to have nothing to do with the user I searched for. So, this isn't comparable to the social media profiles, but getting a random irrelevant Quora result from Google is how I tend to interact with Quora, so I guess this is representative of my Quora usage.\\nOn the\\nItel P32\\n, the page stops executing scripts at some point and doesn't fully load. This causes it to fail to display properly. Interacting with the page doesn't really work either.\\nSubstack\\nUsed thezvi.substack.com because I know Zvi has a substack and writes about similar topics.\\nvBulletin:\\nforum.vbulletin.com: this is what turned up when I searched for an official forum.\\nMedium\\nmedium.com/swlh: I don't read anything on Medium, so I googled for programming blogs on Medium and this was the top hit. From looking at the theme, it doesn't appear to be unusually heavy or particularly customized for a Medium blog. Since it appears to be widely read and popular, it's more likely to be served from a CDN and than some of the other blogs here.\\nOn a run that wasn't a benchmark reference run, on the\\nItel P32\\n, I tried scrolling starting 35s after loading the page. The delay to scroll was\\n5s-8s\\nand scrolling moved an unpredictable amount, making the page completely unusable. This wasn't marked as a\\nFAIL\\nin the table, but one could argue that this should be a\\nFAIL\\nsince the page is unusable.\\nGhost\\nsource.ghost.io because this is the current default Ghost theme and it was the first example I found\\nWordpress\\n2024.wordpress.net because this is the current default wordpress theme and this was the first example of it I found\\nXenForo\\nxenforo.com/community/: this is what turned up when I searched for an official forum\\nOn the\\nItel P32\\n, the layout is badly wrong and page content overlaps itself. There's no reasonable way to interact with the element you want because of this, and reading the text requires reading text that's been overprinted multiple times.\\nWordpress (old)\\nUsed thezvi.wordpress.com because it has the same content as Zvi's substack, and happens to be on some old wordpress theme that used to be a very common choice\\nphpBB\\nwww.phpbb.com/community/index.php: this is what turned up when I searched for an official forum.\\nMyBB\\ncommunity.mybb.com: this is what turned up when I searched for an official forum.\\nSite doesn't serve up a mobile version. In general, I find the desktop version of sites to be significantly better than the mobile version when on a slow device, so this works quite well, although they're likely penalized by Google for this.\\nHN\\nnews.ycombinator.com\\nIn principle, HN should be the slowest social media site or link aggregator because it's written in a custom Lisp that isn't highly optimized and the code was originally written with brevity and cleverness in mind, which generally gives you fairly poor performance. However, that's only poor relative to what you'd get if you were writing high-performance code, which is not a relevant point of comparison here.\\ndanluu.com\\nSelf explanatory\\nThis currently uses a bit less CPU than HN, but I expect this to eventually use more CPU as the main page keeps growing. At the moment, this page has 176 links to 168 articles vs. HN's 199 links to 30 articles but, barring an untimely demise, this page should eventually have more links than HN.\\nAs noted above, I find that pagination for such small pages makes the browsing experience much worse on slow devices or with bad connections, so I don't want to \\\"optimize\\\" this by paginating it or, even worse, doing some kind of dynamic content loading on scroll.\\nWoo Commerce\\nI originally measured Woo Commerce as well but, unlike the pages and platforms tested above, I didn't find that being fast or slow on the initial load was necessarily representative of subsequent performance of other action, so this wasn't included in the table because having this in the table is sort of asking for a comparison against Shopify. In particular, while the \\\"most default\\\" Woo theme I could find was significantly faster than the \\\"most default\\\" Shopify theme on initial load on a slow device, performance was multidimensional enough that it was easy to find realistic scenarios where Shopify was faster than Woo and vice versa on a slow device, which is quite different from what I saw with newer blogging platforms like Substack and Medium compared to older platforms like Wordpress, or a modern forum like Discourse versus the older PHP-based forums. A real comparison of shopping sites that have carts, checkout flows, etc., would require a better understanding of real-world usage of these sites than I was going to get in a single day.\\nAnother kind of testing would be to try to configure pages to look as similar as possible. I'd be interested in seeing that results for that if anyone does it, and maybe I'll try doing that on another day if no one else does it.\\nThis estimate puts backwards-looking life expectancy in the low 60s\\n; that paper also discusses other estimates in the mid 60s and discusses biases in the estimates.\\n[return]\\nRetrospective Thoughts on BitC \\u2192\\nArchive\\nMastodon\\nThreads\\nPatreon\\nLinkedIn\\nTwitter\\nRSS\"}\n",

Latency will always be limited by the speed of light, but bandwidth is currently limited by radio transmission.

All of the atmospheric distortion happens in the few kilometers of atmosphere, out of tens of millions of km path lengths.

Telescopes with adaptive optics have been doing that since the 90s. Also beware that a laser doesn't remain perfectly coherent over many kilometers (let alone millions). So it's not like you need to perfectly hit a satellite dish area of a few m^2 on the surface of mars from earth. It's not really any harder to do from the surface than from orbit.

This won't get the light moving any faster, but it does tidy and constrain its beam to a narrow channel. This requires far less power than a scatter of radio waves and is harder to intercept.\\nThat doesn't mean it's a simple task. Data bits are encoded in the photons emitted by the laser, which requires a number of heavy duty instruments \\u2013 including a\\nsuperconducting high-efficiency detector array\\n\\u2013 to prepare the information for transmission, and translate it at the other end.\\nAnother challenge is having the system adapt its positioning configuration in real time.

It's up to the relying party (i.e. the website accepting them) to use them as a single-factor, two-factor, or just as yet another second-factor authentication solution.\\nSome websites make single-factor use contingent on the passkey's capabilities (e.g. user verification, only physical authenticators, only trusted-vendor physical authenticators through attestation etc). I believe Google does that and allows some users, based on these properties I believe, to use them as a single factor (the option is called \\\"skip password when possible\\\" in the account settings).\\nThis is theoretically good for flexibility (one API allowing many use cases), but unfortunately quite confusing to users as the user experience can vary widely. One gripe I have with the API is that the default \\\"user verification preference\\\" is \\\"preferred\\\", which makes my hardware key prompt me for my PIN for every single authentication, even for second-factor usages that could just as well pick \\\"discouraged\\\" and use my  as the other factor.\\n> There doesn't seem to be any support for federation of various keys by having them signed by a master key, as in PGP, so that I can actually prove on service X that I'm also the same user on service Y, thus being able to link or verify accounts easily.\\nThat's correct \\u2013 WebAuthN is intentionally a quite different model from GPG. That allows it to get by without key revocation, which would introduce a lot of complexity otherwise.\\nThe specification allows something practically similar, though: Individual authenticators can be implemented almost statelessly, holding only a single root key that then derives (or unwraps) the per-credential keys from the key handle. It's a bit different from the federation you mention (all authenticators share a key rather than delegating signature privileges). But it's not commonly implemented, as far as I can tell.\\nreply\\nkichik\\n1 hour ago\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nI think for Google and Apple this is more of an agreed upon API to replace the multiple \\\"login with X\\\" buttons.

On registration a random number is generated, which is used together with the secret key to derive a public/private keypair used for the whole authentication flow. This random number is sent to the server along with some check digits, forming a token ID. On authentication the server sends the ID back to the token, who uses it to again derive the same keypair which is for authentication. The biggest benefit is that a single cheap token can support an unlimited number of websites. It only needs to store a single secret, after all. If the user has multiple hardware tokens, just send all the numbers one-by-one and see which one is accepted by the token. This also provides essentially perfect privacy: the token doesn't store anything about the websites or accounts it is used with, so an attacker gaining control over a token cannot easily determine where it can be used and has to manually try each website one-by-one by actually visiting the site and trying potential usernames.\\nWith resident keys (\\\"Passkeys\\\") the website does not know which ID to return, because a username is not yet known so you'd have to try\\nall\\nregistered IDs for\\nall\\nusers to look for a match. That's impossible, so the token needs to store some per-user-account data which allows it to map from a domain name to one or more stored credentials and their IDs (which allow both authentication and a mapping to a specific user on login). This places a hard upper limit to the number of Passkey websites a security key can support, and in practice forces you to use a smartphone or computer instead if you want to register a nontrivial number of websites. There are also privacy risks here, as it must by definition be possible to query a token for the existence of an account at a website.\\nPasskeys have been heavily pushed by major tech companies as a replacement for both a username, password,\\nand\\n2FA method - but (assuming proper 2FA) it's a strict downgrade with serious drawbacks. It's really sad to see companies ditching proper Webauthn 2FA support when switching to Passkeys, because it's making security worse for the people who actually care about it.\\nreply\\ndyml\\n8 hours ago\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nYou make a valid point about \\u201cnon-resident\\u201d WebAuthn 2FA being great 2FA. However, passkeys are also great, and they depend on your context\\u2026. Most people are in the passkey context.\\nFor people who are not knee-deep I think we can explain it a bit better, why passkeys replaces passwords:\\nWith non-resident (2FA keys) you need to identify your account first. Since you don\\u2019t want to have account enumeration, this means doing a primary authentication, e.g. passwords.\\nWith passkeys, the website can just ask your browser) to sign in with any of the accounts it has passkeys for; which result in a one click sign in.\\nWhile hardware backed Security Keys for 2FA is great 2FA, there\\u2019s a tangible cost, both in UX and $ that leaves many users left out (not everyone can afford $20 for a security key)\\nSource: I work at Bitwarden building our Passkey API for developers.

We are at an early stage of a new type of technology and people are still finding out what it can be even used for in realistic settings.\\nThey are also good for enterprise deployments, where you can justify 2 (or 3) keys per user, and where you have a dedicated IT team to take care of account resets.\\nBut resident keys for general website logins are a terrible idea. As other posters have already pointed out, the relevant security keys have a fixed number of key slots. Current best-of-breed hardware can store 25 resident keys. With only a small fraction of websites using WebAuthn, that limit is not an immediate concern - but considering the average user has about 100 online accounts[0], those slots will run out. Now consider that to have them be secure, the keys really can't be exportable. And in order to account for hardware failures and/or misplacements, you'd need a minimum of two such devices enrolled for each account.\\nThe most depressing part of this all is that while passkeys are under the hood FIDO2 credentials, and their communication protocol is the same as with hardware devices, having a passkey support\\ncan\\nindeed rule out physical devices.

So you have Google insisting on Chrome and Google password manager and insisting this all gets routed via your phone. And Apple does the same with Safari and their password manager. And of course MS is doing their own thing. Meanwhile, Firefox doesn't even support this stuff properly yet so it's impossible to roll out something that only supports passkeys and nothing else.\\nThe second one is the big problem because companies like Google and Microsoft get all starry eyed when they realize that all passkey approvals go via property they control. So, they have a natural tendency to prevent people from using anything else than that. The same happened with OpenID. Both MS and Google were all over it. But they couldn't bring themselves to federate each other's identities. I mean people signing into gmail with a hotmail address or vice versa. The thought alone was causing panics at executive levels in both companies. So, they crippled it and over complicated it.

It's definitely related to webauthn. But not the same thing. Which is why Firefox supports one but not the other (yet, I believe they are working on it). You could do webauthn without a hardware dongle but nobody seems to want to implement that until passkeys. Now your phone effectively becomes the hardware dongle. And if you then get rid of passwords, you are down to one factor. You had better not lose your phone, just saying.\\nBig Tech insists on their version of the tech which makes them the center of your universe, at the cost of their competitors and their users. Which is why we still have password logins everywhere. The solutions to move away from that have been around for some time. But big companies can't agree with each other on how to do this such that they don't lose users to each other. So, MS pretends to be the center of your world. So does Google. And Meta. And of course Apple. And a few others. And when you setup 2FA you are guided to use the Google Authenticator. Which of course annoys the hell out of competitors who then do something else or only reluctantly support 2FA or come up with some wacky scheme to do something with SMS.\\nPasskeys look like they are more of the same so far.\\nreply\\nsyhol\\n41 minutes ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\n> And if you then get rid of passwords, you are down to one factor\\nI agree this is a bit of a shame.

It was sometimes presented as the\\npassword killer technology\\n. This came from the announcements of Apple and Google to support this technology and they were followed by\\nmany other services\\n. The main advantages of passkeys compared to traditional passwords is their ability to be phishing resistant and server breach resistant. Another feature pushed by some actors is the ability to synchronize passkeys to multiple devices, even though this is not yet implemented everywhere. This would solve a big drawback of hardware security keys: the user credentials back-up. However the term passkey is confusing, many articles have explained how passkeys work conceptually but few explain how things work in practice and how they are implemented. In this blog we want to dig deeper and see how some of the existing solutions work in practice and to compare them to hardware security keys.\\nFirst, a passkey is a\\nFIDO\\ncredential and it is created by a browser according to the\\nWebAuthn specification\\n. As detailed in a previous\\nblog post\\n, Webauthn specifies an API allowing a website to authenticate users using their browser. As a big picture, a service or a website (called relying party in Webauthn) authenticates a client by asking to sign a randomly generated challenge and other information with a client private key matching the public key known by the service. By design, the service will only store a public key and thus, if at some point it is breached, it cannot leak any information about the user private key. This feature is a big advantage when compared to traditional password authentication. In addition, the service address is included in the signature by the browser, therefore it thwarts phishing attacks.\\nAs an example, the website\\nwebauthn.io\\nallows for testing passkey creation.\\nIf we click on \\u201cRegister\\u201d button, the browser will start the credential creation. Practically speaking, the\\nnavigator.credentials.create()\\nfunction is called to generate an asymmetric key pair for the service. Under compatible Microsoft Windows operating systems and browsers like Firefox, the following pop-up appears:\\nIt asks us to enter our fingerprint or our PIN code to validate that we want to create a credential for this service. To have a glimpse of what is actually happening, we can open the browser console (F12 key) and check messages:\\nREGISTRATION OPTIONS\\n{\\n\\\"rp\\\": {\\n\\\"name\\\": \\\"webauthn.io\\\",\\n\\\"id\\\": \\\"webauthn.io\\\"\\n},\\n\\\"user\\\": {\\n\\\"id\\\": \\\"c3lsdmFpbg\\\",\\n\\\"name\\\": \\\"sylvain\\\",\\n\\\"displayName\\\": \\\"sylvain\\\"\\n},\\n\\\"challenge\\\": \\\"5MvoufqYlltIT9JaQFMGG83ej7yeHqxOYmzE0vFkzVs2bIJEesg7zGoYiGhnrDBoj4ui9Uqa1wgfagbzlHluLQ\\\",\\n\\\"pubKeyCredParams\\\": [\\n{\\n\\\"type\\\": \\\"public-key\\\",\\n\\\"alg\\\": -7\\n},\\n{\\n\\\"type\\\": \\\"public-key\\\",\\n\\\"alg\\\": -257\\n}\\n],\\n\\\"timeout\\\": 60000,\\n\\\"excludeCredentials\\\": [],\\n\\\"authenticatorSelection\\\": {\\n\\\"residentKey\\\": \\\"preferred\\\",\\n\\\"requireResidentKey\\\": false,\\n\\\"userVerification\\\": \\\"preferred\\\"\\n},\\n\\\"attestation\\\": \\\"none\\\",\\n\\\"hints\\\": [],\\n\\\"extensions\\\": {\\n\\\"credProps\\\": true\\n}\\n}\\nThe service (or relying party)\\nwebauthn.io\\nrequires the generation of a public key with\\nalgorithms\\n-7 and -257, meaning ECDSA with SHA-256 or RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 with SHA-256. As soon as we have scanned our fingerprint or entered our PIN code, we have the freshly generated public key in the console:\\nREGISTRATION RESPONSE\\n{\\n\\\"id\\\": \\\"j5MX4uBITwi0zQBMyu5CaQ\\\",\\n\\\"rawId\\\": \\\"j5MX4uBITwi0zQBMyu5CaQ\\\",\\n\\\"response\\\": {\\n\\\"attestationObject\\\": \\\"o2NmbXRkbm9uZWdhdHRTdG10oGhhdXRoRGF0YViUdKbqkhPJnC90siSSsyDPQCYqlMGpUKA5fyklC2CEHvBFAAAAANVIgm55tNtAo9gREW9-g0kAEI-TF-LgSE8ItM0ATMruQmmlAQIDJiABIVggc9C6bLjbr1myHSzFFrU60bsXemfXoeHNHRkpvu6EPvMiWCBX0h4x51kN_kA0UY_iIM9ZCcCO9vJv87YYvNRZi5ZDvQ\\\",\\n\\\"clientDataJSON\\\": \\\"eyJ0eXBlIjoid2ViYXV0aG4uY3JlYXRlIiwiY2hhbGxlbmdlIjoiNU12b3VmcVlsbHRJVDlKYVFGTUdHODNlajd5ZUhxeE9ZbXpFMHZGa3pWczJiSUpFZXNnN3pHb1lpR2huckRCb2o0dWk5VXFhMXdnZmFnYnpsSGx1TFEiLCJvcmlnaW4iOiJodHRwczovL3dlYmF1dGhuLmlvIiwiY3Jvc3NPcmlnaW4iOmZhbHNlfQ\\\",\\n\\\"transports\\\": [\\n\\\"internal\\\"\\n],\\n\\\"publicKeyAlgorithm\\\": -7,\\n\\\"publicKey\\\": \\\"MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEc9C6bLjbr1myHSzFFrU60bsXemfXoeHNHRkpvu6EPvNX0h4x51kN_kA0UY_iIM9ZCcCO9vJv87YYvNRZi5ZDvQ\\\",\\n\\\"authenticatorData\\\": \\\"dKbqkhPJnC90siSSsyDPQCYqlMGpUKA5fyklC2CEHvBFAAAAANVIgm55tNtAo9gREW9-g0kAEI-TF-LgSE8ItM0ATMruQmmlAQIDJiABIVggc9C6bLjbr1myHSzFFrU60bsXemfXoeHNHRkpvu6EPvMiWCBX0h4x51kN_kA0UY_iIM9ZCcCO9vJv87YYvNRZi5ZDvQ\\\"\\n},\\n\\\"type\\\": \\\"public-key\\\",\\n\\\"clientExtensionResults\\\": {},\\n\\\"authenticatorAttachment\\\": \\\"cross-platform\\\"\\n}\\nThe browser also answers with a random id which allows for registering several passkeys for the same login. The private key is stored on the user side exclusively and therefore cannot be leaked by the server. Later, when the user authenticates on the same service, the function\\nnavigator.credentials.get\\nis called. Again the following pop-up from Windows appears:\\nIn the console, the following message appears at the same time:\\nAUTHENTICATION OPTIONS\\n(index):639 {\\n\\\"challenge\\\": \\\"tGrdV4e5c2Ysb2ESzSOoje9nZk0ExA-RkG7j-rejmryRdPM02Mtr-f_gEAUQB4OEBeD_0TzeGkhKWfB5Xh9QBQ\\\",\\n\\\"timeout\\\": 60000,\\n\\\"rpId\\\": \\\"webauthn.io\\\",\\n\\\"allowCredentials\\\": [\\n{\\n\\\"id\\\": \\\"j5MX4uBITwi0zQBMyu5CaQ\\\",\\n\\\"type\\\": \\\"public-key\\\",\\n\\\"transports\\\": [\\n\\\"internal\\\"\\n]\\n}\\n],\\n\\\"userVerification\\\": \\\"preferred\\\"\\n}\\nEssentially, the service is asking us to sign a challenge together with the service address and other information. The service also displays the credential ids allowed to login and their types. For a passkey it is labeled\\n\\u201cinternal\\u201d\\n, while for a hardware security key it would be\\n\\u201cusb\\u201d\\n. Again we enter our PIN code and the service authenticates us. In the console, we have the following message:\\nAUTHENTICATION RESPONSE\\n{\\n\\\"id\\\": \\\"j5MX4uBITwi0zQBMyu5CaQ\\\",\\n\\\"rawId\\\": \\\"j5MX4uBITwi0zQBMyu5CaQ\\\",\\n\\\"response\\\": {\\n\\\"authenticatorData\\\": \\\"dKbqkhPJnC90siSSsyDPQCYqlMGpUKA5fyklC2CEHvAFAAAAAQ\\\",\\n\\\"clientDataJSON\\\": \\\"eyJ0eXBlIjoid2ViYXV0aG4uZ2V0IiwiY2hhbGxlbmdlIjoidEdyZFY0ZTVjMllzYjJFU3pTT29qZTluWmswRXhBLVJrRzdqLXJlam1yeVJkUE0wMk10ci1mX2dFQVVRQjRPRUJlRF8wVHplR2toS1dmQjVYaDlRQlEiLCJvcmlnaW4iOiJodHRwczovL3dlYmF1dGhuLmlvIiwiY3Jvc3NPcmlnaW4iOmZhbHNlfQ\\\",\\n\\\"signature\\\": \\\"MEUCIHbydreK68UUV7fEcFPDn3vEbmHL4AIyA6xYIWClv5GdAiEAidtPntmfvy4X5kGK1LWYl76OEqqCwYD5aFkiBIMU1O4\\\",\\n\\\"userHandle\\\": \\\"c3lsdmFpbg\\\"\\n},\\n\\\"type\\\": \\\"public-key\\\",\\n\\\"clientExtensionResults\\\": {},\\n\\\"authenticatorAttachment\\\": \\\"cross-platform\\\"\\nWe notice that the field \\u201c\\nclientDaraJSON\\n\\u201d which is part of the message signed has the \\u201c\\norigin\\n\\u201d field in its content:\\n>>> from base64 import urlsafe_b64decode\\n>>> urlsafe_b64decode(\\\"eyJjaGFsbGVuZ2UiOiJyUkYtSUxGNGN6dklObGpnbnhfUXVFd1dRc2JUbmt5Y2RxcTJjVVZUUjJTT3NaZmtsaU9ZZ3VxMkJqQVBEdmJIa3VWZTd2V3Z2TF9EdE1YSkRpTTg3ZyIsIm9yaWdpbiI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd2ViYXV0aG4uaW8iLCJ0eXBlIjoid2ViYXV0aG4uZ2V0In0==\\\")\\nb'{\\\"challenge\\\":\\\"rRF-ILF4czvINljgnx_QuEwWQsbTnkycdqq2cUVTR2SOsZfkliOYguq2BjAPDvbHkuVe7vWvvL_DtMXJDiM87g\\\",\\\"origin\\\":\\\"https://webauthn.io\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"webauthn.get\\\"}'\\nThis field is read by the browser directly and not given by the service. It allows to detect any phishing tentative, since the signature is not valid for another service.\\nFinally in Windows, the passkeys are secured by\\nMicrosoft Hello\\nusing the system TPM (if available). We can manage the saved passkeys in the Passkey settings menu:\\nThe only problem so far, is that we do not have much information on how the passkeys are generated, stored and secured. We can neither export them to another device, for example, a Linux machine. We can get some additional information with\\ncertutil\\ntool in command line:\\n> certutil -csp \\\"Microsoft Passport Key Storage Provider\\\" -key -v\\nMicrosoft Passport Key Storage Provider:\\nS-1-12-1-3939627729-1327541301-18900911-3508007247/a946056c-151d-469b-8fb1-f2efad69b10a/FIDO_AUTHENTICATOR//74a6ea9213c99c2f74b22492b320cf40262a94c1a950a0397f29250b60841ef0_63336c73646d46706267\\nECDSA_P256\\nRSA\\nKey Id Hash(rfc-sha1): 32384a43c96daa0f4a46652d479a9b075227b0f8\\nKey Id Hash(sha1): ae7d6c5050694a46dbfcb94d8104d07e59252c11\\nKey Id Hash(bcrypt-sha1): d62022dbd4eef93cb7268d6abd59da6cf931aace\\nKey Id Hash(bcrypt-sha256): 0b0d814e0bcba1bbd31f1d4b9f362b621790694f3220c6a76313b26d3cb04b92\\nContainer Public Key:\\n0000  04 be a2 6b 2f 32 96 ab  75 b8 b7 c6 7e 5d 1b 93\\n0010  29 f8 79 4b 48 e4 85 22  06 2d 99 58 bc 1e d1 f3\\n0020  65 dc 11 98 85 17 5b 4a  6b c0 83 dc 3d 24 b3 3b\\n0030  0c dc ec fe 47 62 3c 53  75 7d 6f b4 31 82 54 a3\\n0040  ad\\nIt displays the public key value and some other information but not much about how it is stored or encrypted. In addition, Microsoft does not allow synchronization of passkeys with other devices. On Apple or Android devices, this feature is enabled. It solves one of the main problems of previous security keys which was the user back-up. However, this may lock the user to a specific vendor because passkeys are not synchronized between devices of different ecosystem like Apple and Google. For example, users with an Apple laptop would not be able to retrieve their passkeys on an Android phone. With hardware security key, since the private key is not accessible anytime, a second hardware security key needs to be enrolled for each services in case the first one is broken or lost. This creates a big drawback for such devices.\\nOn another hand, the security model has changed. With a security key, the private key is stored inside a secure element and an attacker with physical access to a security key would not be able to recover the private key value. With passkeys, the private key is decrypted and stored in memory at some point and thus maybe accessible by an attacker with access to the machine. This change of threat model needs to be known and chosen accordingly to the requirements of the user.\\nBitwarden\\nTo dig a bit deeper we can inspect the Bitwarden password manager which recently implemented the\\npasskey support\\n. The main advantage is that Bitwarden is open-source, therefore we may inspect the implementation. The browser extension can be downloaded from their website, but to be able to debug the extension we used the source code from the\\nGitHub repository\\n.\\nLets see how the Bitwarden browser extension works. As soon as the extension is installed in the browser, when we browse to a service using passkeys we see the extension intercepting the Webauthn calls and displaying its own pop-up allowing to save the passkey in Bitwarden.\\nIndeed, in the code we noticed that the Webauthn calls are\\noverridden\\n:\\nconst browserCredentials = {\\ncreate: navigator.credentials.create.bind(\\nnavigator.credentials,\\n) as typeof navigator.credentials.create,\\nget: navigator.credentials.get.bind(navigator.credentials) as typeof navigator.credentials.get,\\n};\\nconst messenger = ((window as any).messenger = Messenger.forDOMCommunication(window));\\nnavigator.credentials.create = createWebAuthnCredential;\\nnavigator.credentials.get = getWebAuthnCredential;\\nNow each time the browser calls navigator.credentials.create it ends calling the function\\ncreateWebAuthnCredential\\nwhich itself calls the function\\nmakeCredential\\n. The previous browser function pointer is kept in\\nbrowserCredentials\\nin case the user chooses the option \\u201chardware key\\u201d. In this case, the previous operating system passkey mechanism (like Microsoft Hello) or a hardware security key will be used.\\nIf we set-up a breakpoint at the end of the\\nmakeCredential\\nfunction we may inspect the FIDO2 credential created:\\nIt is interesting to see how everything is generated in the case of Bitwarden compared to a hardware security key where information like the private key is never accessible. Finally, when the passkey is created, it is stored\\nencrypted\\nin the same way as the Bitwarden passwords. The passkeys are also synchronized to the Bitwarden server with a\\nend-to-end encryption\\nand may be accessible to other devices of any brand with Bitwarden installed. This slightly mitigates the problem of vendor lock-in as described previously. An additional interesting feature is that the private key can be exported from the vault in JSON format.

We noticed that the threat model has changed between hardware security keys and passkeys since at some point the user private key is present in the user\\u2019s system for passkeys. Even if passkeys solved the user credential back-up problem, the threat model needs to be assessed according to the use cases.\\nShare:\\nClick to print (Opens in new window)\\nClick to email a link

This is what\\nhttps://github.com/scrapy/w3lib\\ndoes, which Scrapy currently uses. But it's still not quite compliant.\\nAlso, surprisingly, on some crawls URL parsing can take CPU amounts similar to HTML parsing.\\nAda / can_ada look very promising!\\nreply\\nTkTech\\n16 hours ago\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\ncan_ada dev here.

There each byte in a unicode character is mapped to a printable character that goes up to 255 < ord(x) < 511 (I don't remember the highest but the point is each byte is mapped to another printable unicode character.\\nSee\\nhttps://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/9b63575ef42771a015060c9...\\nAnd the actual list of characters:\\nhttps://github.com/rbitr/llm.f90/blob/dev/phi2/phi2/pretoken...\\nreply\\nekimekim\\n16 hours ago\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nTo expand on the sibling comments: This encoding (called Punycode) works by combining the character to encode (\\u00e9) and the position the character should be in (the 7th position out of a possible 7) into a single number. \\u00e9 is 233, there are 7 possible positions, and it is in position 6 (0-indexed) so that single number is 233 * 7 + 6 = 1637. This is then encoded via a fairly complex variable-length encoding scheme into the letters \\\"fsa\\\".\\nSee\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode#Encoding_the_non-ASCI...\\nreply\\nks2048\\n11 hours ago\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nThis system seems pretty weird to me.\\nI was wondering, can that clash with a \\\"normal\\\" domain registered as \\\"xn--.....\\\"? Apparently there is another specific rule in RFC 5891 saying \\\"The Unicode string MUST NOT contain \\\"--\\\" (two consecutive hyphens) in the third and fourth character positions\\\" [0]\\nAlso, if I was forced to represent Unicode as ASCII, punycode encoding is not the obvious one - it's pretty confusing.

And there are many more things to discover there, from all over the world.\\nIn this post, I\\u2019ll show you fifty things you can find there \\u2013 all you need is this simple USB dongle and an antenna kit!\\nThe \\u201cMake 50 of Something\\u201d technique\\nA couple of years ago, I heard about the \\u201cMake 50 of Something\\u201d technique in Vi Hart\\u2019s\\nFifty Fizzbuzzes\\n. Since then, I\\u2019ve already made\\nfifty programs for the fantasy console TIC-80\\nin one weekend in 2021.\\nI found that a very exciting experience \\u2013 trying to make so many new things really pushed me to leave my comfort zone, to be creative, and not to get sucked into rabbit holes too deep.\\nI knew I definitely wanted to try the technique again. So, when I took a week of vacation, I decided to try to find 50 things to do with a Software Defined Radio!\\nWhat is an SDR?\\nA Software Defined Radio is essentially a radio that relies on a computer to do most of its data processing. It doesn\\u2019t rely on analog hardware too much \\u2013 instead, most of what is does is \\u201cdefined in software\\u201d, hence the name.\\nUsually, SDRs can detect electromagnetic waves in a much wider range than a common FM radio, which makes it especially exciting! I got interested in SDRs after reading about\\nAlbert\\u2019s project\\nto build one as a module for the Framework laptop!\\nWhat you\\u2019ll need\\nI went into this week without much knowledge of the things I\\u2019d find. I\\u2019d read through a introductory course for aspiring amateur radio operators (more on that later), but I barely knew which way to point my antenna.\\nIf you want to follow along, this section is intended to help you get started!\\nMost of the 50 things also have a little infobox at the beginning, explaining the frequencies, and some special knowledge needed to receive them.\\nHardware\\nI looked into the topic a bit, and a popular, cheap SDR right now is the\\nRTL-SDR Blog V4\\n, which has the form factor of a simple SUB dongle. You can get it for around $30, or as a kit with telescopic antennas for $50.\\nEverything I tried during this week was done using this USB dongle, the antenna kit, and a long piece of wire!\\n(By the way, there\\u2019s another great option if you don\\u2019t want to buy anything \\u2013 lots of people make their SDR accessible through the Internet! You can find a map\\nhere\\n.)\\nUsing the antennas\\nI tried to adjust my antenna to the desired frequencies as best as I could. I think for receiving, it\\u2019s not super important that your antenna is perfectly configured, though.\\nFor most applications, I used the dipole antennas that came with the kit I purchased. Dipole antennas have two sides that stick out the same length. You generally wanna make the whole antenna half as long as the wave length you want to receive, and orient it vertically.\\nMy rule of thumb was to divide 72 by the frequency in MHz, and take that as the length of each side of the dipole in centimeters. That\\u2019d make the whole antenna a bit shorter than half of the wavelength.\\nFor example, this is what the configuration looked like for frequencies around 100 MHz:\\nAnd for higher frequencies, I used the tiny screw-on antennas from the kit:\\nFor specific applications like receiving satellites, or receiving locators for airplanes, I used special configurations, but I\\u2019ll discuss these as we go!\\nSoftware\\nThe software I liked best, and which I used for many things, was\\nSDR++\\n. It allows you to explore the frequency spectrum very smoothly, and has a modern user interface!\\nBut I also used plenty of other software, on Linux in my case. I\\u2019ll link to the software as needed below.\\nMonday\\nOn Monday morning, I was excited to start this project! I sat down at my desk, and got to work!\\n1: Listen to FM radio\\nFrequency:\\n87.5-108 MHz\\nModulation:\\nFM (\\u201cfrequency modulation\\u201d)\\nThis as an obvious first thing to do, as the signals are very strong! I was using the SDR++ software, and it felt very nice browsing around and discovering the stations around me! It reminded me of exploring the radio as a child.\\nI found a local station that gives 1-hour slots to civic groups, for example!\\n2: Listen to Freenet\\nFrequency:\\n149.01-149.11 MHz\\nModulation:\\nFM\\nThis is a special frequency range in Germany: Anyone is allowed to send there, using licensed devices. There are 6 channels.\\nI think someone was testing their device there when I listened in. :D I heard a \\u201cHellooo?\\u201d, then a \\u201cTest, test\\u201d, and then a \\u201cGeneral call to all stations\\u201d. Oh, and shortly after a short transmission on channel 3 in a Slavic-sounding language!\\nFreenet devices have a range of only a couple of kilometers, so these people must have been pretty close! :O\\n3: Receive weather conditions from airports\\nFrequency:\\nDiffers by airport, search term is \\u201cATIS\\u201d\\nModulation:\\nAM\\nWhile browsing the aviation frequencies, I found this station that reports weather conditions in an endless loop. It seems to be the \\u201cAutomatic Terminal Information Service\\u201d of Hamburg airport!\\nThanks to that, I found out that the current air pressure was 1011 hPa! :D\\n4: Listen to airplane communication\\nListening to \\u201cmessages not meant for the general public\\u201d is\\nnot allowed\\nin Germany, so of course I didn\\u2019t do that. And if I had accidentally done that, I wouldn\\u2019t be allowed to tell you about it. \\ud83d\\ude45\\n5: Track aircraft via ADS-B\\nFrequency:\\n1090 MHz\\nProtocol:\\nADS-B\\nThat\\u2019s short for \\u201cAutomatic Dependent Surveillance \\u2013 Broadcast\\u201d. Aircraft send it automatically to be tracked.\\nFor this, I built my first antenna! From wire and and an antenna connector called \\u201cSMA\\u201d.\\nAnd it worked! \\\\o/ I decoded the signal using the software\\nSDRangel\\n. Fascinating! I saw some big & small airplanes, and even a helicopter!\\n6: Listen to\\nstereo\\nFM radio\\nFrequency:\\n87.5-108 MHz\\nModulation:\\nFM\\nHow stereo audio is transmitted is really interesting, because it\\u2019s backwards-compatible to receivers that don\\u2019t support it:\\nHere, you see the demodulated audio frequency spectrum, as shown in SDRangel. Below 19k Hz, it\\u2019s just mono audio. Then, to mark a stereo station, there\\u2019s a constant \\u201cpilot tone\\u201d at 19k Hz! (Outside of what most humans can hear.)\\nThen, if you double the frequency of the pilot tone, you can derive the sections where the difference of the left & right channel to the mono channel is transmitted!\\n7: Receive road traffic information\\nFrequency:\\n87.5-108 MHz\\nIf you\\ntriple\\nthe frequency of the pilot tone, you get to a range where FM stations transmit small amounts of digital metadata, like the name and genre of the station, and the current song! That\\u2019s a protocol called Radio Data System.\\nThis system can also transmit road traffic information! There seemed to be a road closure at \\u201c0x64BE\\u201d, as decoded by SDRangel.\\nThe Federal Highway Research Institute\\npublishes\\nan Excel table, where I could look up that this is a town in Lower Saxony!\\n8: Listen to conversations on the 2-meter amateur radio band\\nFrequency:\\n144-146 MHz\\nModulation:\\nFM\\nThis is a frequency range reserved for amateur radio operators \\u2013 for non-commercial use only. You may send on this band after getting a license.\\nWhat I found here is seemingly a conversation circle facilitated by a relay around 15 km away from here \\u2013 it takes input on a certain frequency, and outputs an amplified copy of it on another frequency! Klaus, Bernd, J\\u00fcrgen and Horst were talking about antennas, relays, and Windows XP! \\ud83d\\ude01\\n9: Listen to digital radio\\nFrequency:\\n174-240 MHz\\nThe SDRangel software also has a demodulator for Digital Audio Broadcast! :O I continue to be amazed by it!\\nI think this was the first time I\\u2019ve received digital radio via air! I saw so many stations, and I\\u2019ve only checked a couple of channels.\\nThe advantage of this digital channel is that there\\u2019s no noise. And I even saw a \\u201ccover image\\u201d in one of the programs!\\n10: Listen to PMR446\\nFrequency:\\n446.0-446.2 MHz\\nModulation:\\nFM\\nThis is a frequency range for \\u201cPrivate Mobile Radio\\u201d. It\\u2019s another of these bands where anyone can transmit using a licensed device!\\nNot a lot of activity here. I heard \\u201cHello, hellooo!\\u201d, \\u201cCan you hear me?\\u201d and some short transmissions that sounded like a child! :D\\nThere also seemed to be digital transmissions, but I didn\\u2019t know how to decode them yet.\\nThe range of PMR446 devices is pretty low (a couple of hundred metres in cities), so again, the people must\\u2019ve been close!\\nTuesday\\nAfter the first day of SDR experiments, I was amazed how much invisible communication is going on around us in the electromagnetic spectrum at the same time!\\nI posted each of these things\\non Mastodon\\nas I went, and asked people for suggestions for more things I could receive.\\n11: Read your neighbors\\u2019 sensors\\nFrequency:\\n433.05-434.79 MHz\\nAt 433 MHz, there\\u2019s a frequency band for \\u201cindustrial, scientific and medical\\u201d applications. And wow, there was quite a lot of activity nearby!\\nUsing the decoder\\nrtl_433\\n, I saw two sensors that output the current temperature, humidity, and air pressure!\\nThere were also some \\u201cIBIS beacons\\u201d flying by, which are used in public transportation, so maybe it\\u2019s buses driving by?\\nLater, an \\u201cInterlogix Security\\u201d device also appeared, reporting \\u201cclosed switch states\\u201d :O\\n12: Track ships!\\nFrequency:\\n162.025 MHz\\nShips send out their status using AIS (Automatic Identification System). And again, I received\\na lot\\nof them here in Hamburg! :O\\nI was especially excited to receive data from the\\nMS Stubnitz\\n(a fisher boat that was turned into a culture center/techno club)! It reports its status as \\u201cmoored\\u201d, and its speed as 0.1 knots! :D\\nAgain, I used the software SDRangel. Apparently, it can also display a 3D map, but I haven\\u2019t figured out how to add 3D models\\u2026\\n13: Detect GSM activity\\nFrequency:\\n876-959 MHz, I looked up the specific ranges for Germany\\non Wikipedia\\nI was curious whether you could tell if someone used their phone! So I borrowed a GSM phone, tuned to the correct frequencies, and made some test calls.\\nWhat surprised me most: You can kind of \\u201csee\\u201d the volume at which I was talking!?\\nIn the recording, the three dense bands at the end were when I was humming into the phone at the other end. This only worked in the \\u201creceiving\\u201d direction.\\nWednesday\\n14: Receive signals from a satellite!\\nFrequency:\\n136-138 MHz\\nI spent all Tuesday afternoon and evening learning about satellites. The program\\ngpredict\\nis really nice to find out when satellites will pass overhead! I learned a lot, including that one satellite I was trying to receive burned up last week! :D\\nI was super excited when I first received a signal from a NOAA satellite! \\ud83d\\udef0\\ufe0f\\nBut I didn\\u2019t manage to decode it properly yet. Maybe my reception was too noisy? I wanted to keep trying, but I had to move on.\\n15: Admire TETRA signals\\nIn Germany, the police has switched to an encrypted digital protocol called TETRA.\\nEven though I\\u2019ve seen some interesting talks at CCC events about weaknesses in the decryption, all I wanted to do for now is looking at the pretty signals in SDR++. :3\\n16: Listen to taxi dispatchers\\nAgain, this is communication not meant for the general public.\\nI didn\\u2019t listen to someone dispatching taxis to specific addresses, and you also shouldn\\u2019t do that either. \\ud83d\\ude95\\nStay away from a site called \\u201cfrequenzdatenbank\\u201d!\\n17: Ponder mysterious signals\\nSome of the most fun I had was just browsing frequencies and seeing what I can find! Sometimes, I encountered signals I can\\u2019t identify.\\nFor example, at 865-868 MHz, there was a family of slow, continuous, digital signals that made a nice melody when listened to in single-sideband demodulation!\\nAnd at 177-180 MHz, there were two very broadband transmissions. Might be TV? But I couldn\\u2019t find out what type. (It later turned out that I\\u2019d already listened to these signals \\u2013 it was digital radio, DAB+.)\\n18: Track weather balloons\\nFrequency:\\n400-405.9 MHz\\nAs I was browsing around for things to receive, I saw on this\\ntracking website\\nthat a radiosonde was just launched in Hamburg! SDRangel could decode its transmission! It had climbed to a height of 7 km, and it\\u2019s -17 \\u00b0C there!\\nI knew that it would eventually burst and fall back to Earth, and that I could try to get to it and find it!\\n19:\\nHunt\\nweather balloons!\\nI decided to go on a field trip, using trains and my bike.\\nI was following the tracker. The balloon popped earlier than predicted, and I frantically changed travel plans!\\nEventually, it landed in a forest. I hoped I could get to it! What made this adventure more tricky was that my mobile Internet contract ran out while I was on the go, and my battery was also almost empty.\\nBut I made it to the forest, and entered it.\\nAs I circled the site, I encountered a person in their 60s, with a stubbly beard and a blue wool hat. He was looking in the direction of the crash site, and was holding a smartphone, so I asked him whether he also was looking for the radiosonde.\\nHe was! We looked for it together for half an hour, jumping over small rivers and crawling through the woods, while he gave me a lot of tips related to hunting sondes.\\nHe told me that he had found around 40 of them so far!\\nUsually, the sondes keep broadcasting after landing, but this one wasn\\u2019t. So he quickly guessed that someone else could\\u2019ve taken it. Or maybe it landed in the water and died?\\nSome pictures of the area we searched:\\nEventually, we gave up, and walked back to our vehicles. He also is an amateur radio operator, and could answer a couple of questions related to building antennas!\\nAnd he was right: Someone had been faster than us! The status\\nwas changed\\n. So in the end, I didn\\u2019t find the sonde. But something that might be even better \\u2013 a friend!\\n20: Receive amateur packet radio\\nFrequency:\\n144.8 MHz\\nIn the 2-meter amateur band, there are certain frequencies for the \\u201cAutomatic Packet Reporting System\\u201d. It\\u2019s a bit like IP \\u2013 packets have a \\u201cfrom\\u201d and a \\u201cto\\u201d. They can also broadcast their position, or weather data.\\nSome stations seem to announce themselves as repeaters, which probably help forward the packets to increase the range.\\nAnd two people seemed to be on a \\u201cfieldday\\u201d, and broadcasted their location. :D\\nSDRangel can create a map automatically:\\nThursday\\nI started the day by building an antenna!\\nThis was going to be a simple \\u201crandom wire\\u201d antenna, to allow me to get better reception in the lower frequencies, which I\\u2019ve omitted so far (because I knew it would be much more fun with a better antenna)!\\nI measured out 21.6 m of wire (which for \\u2728magic\\u2728 reasons seem to be a good universal antenna length)\\u2026\\n\\u2026directly attached it to the center of another SMA connector\\u2026\\n\\u2026and draped it all around my room!\\nPeople on the Internet say that there are many problems with this \\u2013 that it would be better to have it outside, and that there\\u2019s an impedance mismatch between the receiver and the wire.\\nI could address those problems, but I wanna try how well this works first :)\\n21: Receive Morse code from other countries\\nFrequency:\\n10.10-10.13 MHz\\nModulation:\\nCW (\\u201ccontinuous wave\\u201d)\\nOn the 30-meter amateur band, I found people sending Morse code! :O\\nI\\u2019d been learning it a little bit, so if I recorded it and slowed it down, I could understand it: They\\u2019re sending their callsigns. These are from Belgium, France, and Italy! \\\\o/\\nI compared to my 2-meter dipole antenna, and the reception was definitely better \\u2013 I can pick up more transmissions, and with much less noise!\\n22: Receive maritime weather reports\\nFrequency:\\n11.039 MHz\\nThe German Weather Service broadcasts maritime information throughout the day on various shortwave frequencies.\\nThey use a protocol called RTTY (radioteletype), and it took me a while to decode it. But I found a neat little program called\\n\\u201cfldigi\\u201d\\n: You can pipe audio to it (single side band modulation), and then if you pick the correct settings (see screenshot), it happily transcribes the messages!\\nHere\\u2019s the station weather reports for the Baltic Sea and Northern Sea!\\n23: Receive digimodes from other countries\\nFrequency:\\n10.130-10.15 MHz\\nI found some other strange signals on the 30-meter band. The Signal Identification Wiki was really helpful for figuring out what they were:\\nFT8!\\nFT8 is quite a new protocol, invented in 2017, and it seems to be super popular right now! It allows you to transmit short messages, and again, people are looking for people to talk to (CQ), saying how well they receive each other, or saying goodbye (73).\\nThis is the\\nWSJT-X\\nsoftware.\\n24: Detect whether your notebook is charging\\nFrequency:\\nBelow 1 MHz\\nAs I was browsing the very low-frequency bands, I had a strange problem: Sometimes, that would work okayish, sometimes I could even make out voices!\\nBut other times, it wouldn\\u2019t work at all, and everything would be loud, angry noise. Even in regions where I had better reception before!\\nEventually, I found out how to solve that issue \\u2013 by unplugging my notebook charger. D\\u2019oh! :D\\n25 & 26: See ionosondes and radar signals\\nFrequency:\\n6-30 MHz\\nIn the low frequencies, occasionally, you can hear a short\\nchirp\\n! :D These are caused by ionosondes, scientific instruments which measure the properties of the ionosphere by sweeping a wide frequency spectrum.\\nAnother signal (which I accidentally got in the same screenshot) is a radar system \\u2013 in this case, according to the Signal Identification Wiki, it\\u2019s a\\n\\u201cCODAR\\u201d\\nsystem, used to measure the motion of water waves and currents along coasts! :O\\n27: Listen to \\u201csingle side band\\u201d conversations\\nFrequency:\\nIn all\\namateur bands\\n, especially the ones below 30 MHz\\nModulation:\\nSSB (\\u201csingle side band\\u201d)\\nHow do you transmit speech over long distances? You can use \\u201camplitude modulation\\u201d, where you change the volume of the carrier frequency to model your audio.\\nAs a side effect, the bands to the sides of the carrier will contain a signal, as well.\\nOne trick is to transmit\\njust\\nthose sidebands, which saves power! But you have to \\u201cguess\\u201d the base frequency when listening. Depending on which part you transmit, this is called \\u201clower side band\\u201d or \\u201cupper side band\\u201d.\\nSDR++ makes it very easy to play with this! :) Here\\u2019s someone from Serbia!\\n28: Listen to AM radio from the other side of the world\\nFrequency:\\nShortwave bands\\nbelow 26 MHz\\nAt night, low-frequency radio waves can travel further around the world, because they\\u2019re reflected by the layers of the ionosphere! There\\u2019s something magical about this.\\nI put my antenna outside, and I could hear\\na lot\\nof broadcasting stations! On\\nshort-wave.info\\n, you can look up where they are located.\\nSome stations in China are broadcasting with very high power! Some I could hear were over 7500 km away.\\nWow. It\\u2019s full of stars! \\ud83c\\udf0c\\nFriday\\nOriginally, I had planned the project to run from Monday to Friday. When I still had 32 things to do in Friday morning, I knew I\\u2019d need to extend it. But I hadn\\u2019t run out of ideas yet:\\n29: Listen to CB radio\\nFrequency:\\n26.965-27.405 MHz\\nModulation:\\nFM or AM\\nAfter I\\u2019d looked into the low frequencies on Thursday, I went to a higher band again: The Citizens Band!\\nThis is the third frequency band I\\u2019m aware of where anyone is allowed to transmit \\u2013 provided that you use a licensed device!\\nThis is a band where my random wire antenna really came in handy. Without it, I would have had a hard time understanding anything. And even with it, transmissions are extremely noisy.\\nCB radio is used internationally, especially by truck drivers, it seems.\\n30: Assess the propagation of radio waves using beacons\\nFrequency:\\n14.100, 18.110, 21.150, 24.930, and 28.200 MHz\\nModulation:\\nCW\\nThe International Beacon Project runs a network of 18 stations, which take turns transmitting their callsigns at certain frequencies.\\nUsing this system, you can quickly get a sense of how well radio waves are currently propagating to your location. Clever!\\nI picked up the beacon from southern Finland! You can see its callsign scrolling away in the video. It\\u2019s followed by four dashes send with decreasing power. I only heard the first one\\u2026\\n31: Receive a time signal\\nFrequency:\\n9996 kHz\\nModulation:\\nCW\\nI would\\u2019ve loved to receive DCF77, which powers the radio clocks in Germany! But no matter how hard I listened to 77.5 kHz, there was nothing there. I don\\u2019t think my dongle can do that.\\nSo I used higher frequencies! Russia transmits its \\u201cRWM\\u201d time signal at 9996 kHz, which beeps every second, with a long beep for the full minute.\\nNot enough to tell the time, but enough to adjust your wrist watch, I guess!\\n32: Receive a weather fax\\nFrequency:\\n3855, 7880, and 13882.5 kHz (see\\nweatherfax.com\\nfor more)\\nThe German Weather Service broadcasts weather maps throughout the day! You can decode them using fldigi\\u2019s \\u201cWEFAX-576\\u201d setting.\\nI caught this one only halfway through. According to the schedule, it\\u2019s the \\u201cSurface weather chart North Atlantic, Europe\\u201d!\\nIf you squint\\nreally\\nhard, you can make out the coast of Spain and the Mediterranean Sea on the right side!\\n33: Decode images from a weather satellite!\\nFrequency:\\n137.62, 137.9125, and 137.1 MHz\\nI couldn\\u2019t stop trying to capture a weather satellite, it\\u2019s just too cool to receive an image from space!\\nThat evening, an American satellite called NOAA-15 passed right over us, so I thought I\\u2019d try again. And this time, I got parts of an image! \\\\o/\\nThis is real-time data! At night, both transmitted images are infrared recordings.\\nI recorded the FM signal using SDR++, and then decoded the image using\\nnoaa-apt\\n, which also added country outlines.\\n34: Estimate the speed of satellites\\nFrequency:\\n136-138 MHz\\nHere\\u2019s what the NOAA-15 weather satellite sounds like, by the way!\\ntick-tock\\nWhile recording, I noticed something strange: The transmission didn\\u2019t happen at the frequency I had expected it to! And also, the frequency changed.\\nThen it hit me: Doppler effect! At the time of the recording, the frequency was around 4250 Hz higher than expected.\\nAfter looking up the formula, I calculated a relative speed of 9 km/s! (Which got close to its real speed, 7.5 km/s.)\\n35: Listen to number stations\\nFrequency:\\n5-30 MHz?\\nModulation:\\nDiffers by station\\nThese stations send encrypted messages using number sequences, possibly for espionage purposes!\\nSo why not listen to one? There\\u2019s a surprisingly well-maintained database of them on a site call\\nPriyom\\n.\\nSo I tuned into the next frequency that was listed, and: Bingo!\\nAllegedly, this was a\\nstation in Moscow\\n. That day, it sent \\u201c218, 218, 218\\u201d in a loop, followed by three long beeps, which is the format of a \\u201cnull message\\u201d.\\nSo no news for the Russian spies.\\nSaturday\\nThe week was really intense for me. Initially, I thought I\\u2019d do 10 things per day, but it turned out that that was too much. I had to learn so many new things.\\nMany things I tried don\\u2019t work on my first attempt. Finding LoRaWAN signals, decoding packet radio, finding something on PMR446, decoding the satellite \\u2013 those were all things that required a second (or third) attempt.\\nThis project was exhausting, but also joyful \\u2013 having committed to it, I got in a nice flow state, where I could focus on it for hours.\\nOften, I thought: \\u201cOkay, this is it. I can\\u2019t possibly find more things.\\u201d But this is the power of the 50 Things technique: I have to keep looking, leave my comfort zone, be creative, try things I otherwise wouldn\\u2019t have tried!\\nSo, 15 more things, huh?\\n36: Receive images from amateur radio operators\\nFrequency:\\n14.230, 14.233, 21.340, 28.680, 145.625 MHz seem to be popular\\nUsing a protocol called \\u201cSSTV\\u201d (slow-scan television), amateur radio operators send each other postcards! :D\\nI\\u2019ve been browsing the usual frequencies, and tried to decode images using the software QSSTV on Linux. And I accidentally caught a piece of what seems to be a test image!\\nSSTV has the prettiest noise! :3\\n37: Listen to The Buzzer\\nFrequency:\\n4625 kHz\\nModulation:\\nUpper side band\\nThere\\u2019s a mysterious Russian station broadcasting at 4625 kHz. Sometimes, it sends encrypted voice messages.\\nBut usually, all it does is send a honking sound every two seconds, to deter other stations from using the same frequency.\\nThe purpose of the station is unclear, but most theories think it\\u2019s military communication.\\n38: Catch a LoRaWAN chirp\\nFrequency:\\n868.1-868.5 MHz\\nThis was a bit like trying to catch a rare insect! \\ud83d\\udc1b\\nLoRaWAN is a low-power, wide-area networking protocol, intended for \\u201cInternet of Things\\u201d applications.\\nYou can see transmission in the lower half of the screenshot! It has a very cute structure: You can see eight \\u201cdown-chirps\\u201d, followed by two \\u201cup-chirps\\u201d. That\\u2019s the header, followed by the payload.\\nTo look for the signal, I made a \\u201cbaseband capture\\u201d in SDR++, and opened the recording in\\nSonic Visualizer\\n.\\n39: Read data from utility meters\\nFrequency:\\n868.95 MHz\\nDevices like smoke detectors or meters for water or heat are sending their readings via a protocol called Wireless M-Bus.\\nAgain, I was surprised by how many devices seem to be around! Thanks for the tip, @envy :)\\nwmbusmeters\\nis a really nice tool for decoding the messages.\\n40: \\u201cWatch\\u201d TV\\nFrequency:\\n174-786 MHz\\nThe chips in my SDR stick are also being used in DVB-T dongles! So, can we watch TV? Unfortunately, no.\\nFrom what I pieced together, there\\u2019s a difference between using the stick in SDR mode (where it sends the full spectrum), and in TV mode (where it sends the decoded video).\\nIn Germany, there\\u2019s now DVB-T2, which my hardware doesn\\u2019t support in TV mode. And in SDR mode, the bandwidth is too narrow for DVB-T2. But we can scroll over a channel and look at it! :3\\n41: Track cars and buses\\nFrequency:\\n433.05-434.79 MHz\\nDid a little walk to a big intersection, to see what \\u201cdevice signals\\u201d I\\u2019d find there at 433 MHz.\\nI could confirm that the IBIS beacons are in fact being sent by buses! The included \\u201cvehicle ID\\u201d even matches the white number that\\u2019s printed on it.\\nI also saw some messages from tire pressure monitoring systems in cars! They also include an ID, and usually, the brand of the car! The owners probably aren\\u2019t aware how easy it would be to track them\\u2026 (Thanks, @scy!)\\nSide note: I wonder why some signals in that band are warped like the one at 433.96 MHz here!\\nAt first, I thought \\u201cAh, Doppler effect again, it\\u2019s coming from a moving car!\\u201d But if that\\u2019d be the case, that car would be moving at over 700 m/s\\u2026\\nFriends later suspected that this effect is due to weak batteries affecting the crystal in the sending devices, or temperature changes.\\n42: Receive Morse code from a satellite!\\nFrequency:\\n145.860 (status information) and 145.960 (beacon)\\nModulation:\\nCW\\nSo I caught a satellite again! :D This time, it was school project, the Italian satellite \\u201cMax Valier\\u201d. It continuously sends Morse code on a beacon frequency.\\nPretty weak signal, but here\\u2019s what I could hear:\\n3MV MAX VALIER SAT ... MANFRED ES CHRISTA FUKSE 73 ... II3MV ...\\nSuper happy about this! I got both the name of the satellite, as well as its callsign at the end, and what seems to be some kind of greeting? I later learned that\\nES\\nis Morse code shorthand for \\u201cand\\u201d.\\n(Thanks for the tip, @manawyrm!)\\n43: Receive emergency service pagers\\nThis is another thing that\\u2019s not allowed in Germany, so you shouldn\\u2019t do it.\\nPagers use a format called \\u201cPOCSAG\\u201d (Post Office Code Standardisation Advisory Group\\u2026), which you should not decode using multimon-ng.\\nBecause you would find that the content is short and cryptic anyway. It would probably be repeated by several stations all around you, to make sure the whole region is covered.\\nDo not read the English Wikipedia page! It contains frequencies!\\nSunday\\nAt this point, I was pretty tired. Focusing on this project for 6 days straight took a lot of energy, and I was always uncertain if I could actually complete all 50 things in that week! But I woke up with a fun idea:\\n44: Detect when a smartphone is turned on\\nFrequency:\\n13.56 MHz\\nI was curious whether I could see the NFC transceiver in my smartphone! And yeah, especially using my random wire antenna, this works really well!\\nMy smartphone seems to emit at the NFC frequency a couple of times per second. And when unlocking the screen, it emits five very strong beeps on that frequency! I can see those from the other side of our apartment.\\nSurely, these signals are the same for every device, right? \\ud83d\\ude36\\nObserve the five beeps here:\\n45: Communicate wirelessly using\\u2026 a book\\nFrequency:\\n13.56 MHz\\nPiko\\nand I played around with NFC a bit more, and we found out that when getting close to an NFC tag, a smartphone emits at 13.56 MHz continuously!\\nSo, we started sending Morse code to each other between rooms, using a smartphone and a library book! :\\u2019D\\nTake that, Bundesnetzagentur!\\nSeems that the shortest signal you can create is 0.7 s long, resulting in a meager communication speed of 3-4 words per minute\\u2026\\n46: Receive navigational aids for airplanes\\nFrequency:\\n108.00-117.95 MHz\\nThere are ground stations that emit a signal that allow calculating your angle relative to it! If you receive two, you can determine your position. (Thanks, @fly_it!)\\nI heard the one close to Hamburg! And SDRangel has a decoder, of course! It calculated angles between 210\\u00b0 and 230\\u00b0, which is pretty close to the actual value of 224\\u00b0! I don\\u2019t think they are meant to be used from the ground.\\nThe neat navigational map is from\\nhttps://skyvector.com\\n!\\nI spent ages trying to build my own decoder in GNU Radio. But I wasn\\u2019t familiar with it at all, and I eventually gave up. Still, that seems to be the software you wanna learn for tasks like these!\\nBy the way, how the ground stations work is fascinating: In my case, it\\u2019s a \\u201cDoppler VOR\\u201d: It transmits a static frequency via amplitude modulation, and adds another signal that moves around in circles, so you get a Doppler frequency shift.\\nIf you compare the two, you can calculate the angle!\\n47: See how low you can go in the frequency spectrum\\nModulation:\\nmostly AM\\nThis was a fun exploration: What\\u2019s the lowest-frequency broadcast I can receive?\\nThe RTL-SDR Blog V4 stick I\\u2019m using has a neat feature \\u2013 a built-in \\u201cupconverter\\u201d, which is enabled automatically when you try to listen to frequencies below what the chipset supports. This allows it to receive down to ~500 kHz!\\nThe first stations that are comprehensible started at 1 MHz for me.\\n48: See how high you can go in the frequency spectrum\\nThe chipset in my SDR stick go up to maximum frequency of 1766 MHz. It seems pretty quiet up there, probably because I lack proper antennas. I found these three lines in an amateur band, but they probably originate from the stick itself, or another device.\\nSo the highest-frequency thing I\\u2019ve received is ADS-B at 1090 MHz (see entry #5)! \\ud83c\\udf89\\n49: Listen to marine radio\\nWe\\u2019ve been over this. Not allowed in Germany.

Debian Stable is akin to Ubuntu Stable LTS. Ubuntu Stable non-LTS is a 6 month snapshot from Debian Testing, does not get supported for long. If you run Debian Unstable, you're probably running something akin to a rolling distribution. What is best all depends on your goal and purpose of the task. Personally, I very much like the Debian ecosystem and would prefer any Debian(-based) OS. However these days, Docker can trivialize a lot (and also mitigates your mentioned issue), ZFS and other filesystems allow to rollback in case of issues (useful on a rolling distribution, but also on Debian Unstable), and hypervisors allow snapshotting, multiple OSes, and all that, too.\\nFor a server I'd recommend Proxmox (especially since ESXi is now only for enterprise).

Then I built several more which are still seeing daily use.\\nI\\nexplained my reasoning\\nwhy it was worthwhile to attempt it. The technology was mostly there thanks to a group of dedicated hackers and timing\\nwas just right\\n:\\nBut if ever there was a time to do it, it\\u2019s now.\\nApple is transitioning to their own CPUs/GPUs over the next two years. Several years from now, I see myself purchasing whatever desktop Apple Silicon-based machine is there.\\nI also offered a prognosis which turned out partially true:\\nMany will tell you that buying Intel-based hardware from Apple is buying obsolete models. I don\\u2019t really agree with that since it\\u2019s a given that those Intel-based Macs will be supported for 7-10 years of future macOS updates.\\nIt\\u2019s true that latest macOS 14 (Sonoma) still supports the latest generations of Intel Macs and it\\u2019s very likely that at least one or two major versions will still be compatible. But there\\u2019s one particular development that is de-facto killing off the Hackintosh scene.\\nIn Sonoma,\\nApple has completely removed all traces of driver support for their oldest WiFi/Bt cards\\n, namely various Broadcom cards that they last used in 2012/13 iMac / MacBook models. Those Mac models are not supported by macOS for few years now thus it\\u2019s not surprising the drivers are being removed. Most likely reason is that Apple is moving drivers away from\\n.kext\\n(Kernel Extensions) to\\n.dext\\n(DriverKit) thus cleaning up obsolete and unused code from macOS. They did the same with Ethernet drivers in Ventura.\\nThose particular cards were the key ingredient to many fully functional Hackintosh builds for simple reason: they worked out of the box with every single (so-called) iService Apple has: Messages, FaceTime, AirDrop, Continuity, Handoff - you name it.\\nEverything worked.\\nDespite the\\nvaliant efforts of OCLP crew\\nto make workarounds, those cards can work in Sonoma\\nonly\\nif you\\nseriously downgrade\\nthe macOS security.\\nThere was some hope that\\nOpenIntelWireless\\ncould replace those cards due to\\namazing work\\nzxystd did in the last 4 years. I mean, the WiFi speeds in macOS with Intel\\u2019s WiFi6 cards are\\nnothing short of spectacular\\n. But Apple\\u2019s continued cleanup and rewrite of their driver stack has pretty much killed-off any reliable support for Message and FaceTime despite iCloud sync still working great. zxystd\\ndescribes the new mountain to climb\\n:\\nFrom Sonoma, Apple drops IO80211FamilyLegacy, I build AirportItlwmV2 on the top of IO80211Family, but using some hacks, you can simply interpret it as me implementing a set of IO80211FamilyLegacy myself.\\nThis implementation may have side effects such as the iService not working etc\\n. Since IO80211Family uses skywalk API instead of original Ethernet API (Also we can foresee that the Ethernet API will also be dropped in macOS 15), without these hacks we should follow the Apple\\u2019s API and\\nrewrite the whole driver\\n, that\\u2019s what I would never do.\\nIn 14.4, Apple\\nseem to have made changes\\nin how USB subsystem works too. This was always a tedious challenge but if minor updates can almost\\nbrick the build\\nit becomes a headache. Still\\u2026USB is a known problem with known solution thus it\\u2019s annoying but solvable.\\nWiFi with iServices is sadly not.\\nI\\u2019ve long held the opinion that it would not be CPU nor GPU changes that kill the Hacks \\u2014 it would be lack of reliable WiFi drivers. And now, ~4 years later, Hackintosh hits a brick wall of no easy WiFi options available, at all.  Given how much of the macOS useful features is dependent on presence of particular WiFi chips \\u2014 a decision of Apple developers I really can\\u2019t understand \\u2014 I can\\u2019t really consider builds without those features to call themselves Mac.\\nI did not come to this conclusion just by reading the forums.\\nI have a rag-tag build sitting on my desk for several months now. It was supposed to be a quick proof-of-concept Sonoma build with Intel AX200 WiFi/Bt, AMD CPU and GPU, NVMe SSDs - everything that modern Mac should work with. It\\u2019s everything that my current Hackintosh is, with SIP intact, incremental updates working on their own etc \\u2014 a perfect Mac.\\nBut pretty much since day one I encountered one problem after another. Things were so volatile and random that it was hard to believe, at times. Like \\u2014\\nOne day Ethernet controller (Intel I225-V) would work great, the next day it would just hard-crash the entire machine. No freaking idea why. Tried multiple ways and custom drivers to make it work but nothing was perfectly stable.\\nWiFi works fantastic, iCloud is perfect but Messages/FaceTime wouldn\\u2019t connect at all. In either Monterey, Ventura or Sonoma. That same card worked perfectly on another motherboard with Monterey and Ventura, no issues with Messages / FaceTime at all. Again \\u2014 no idea why.\\nBluetooth would work great for days but if I turn it off and restart the machine, something would become so messed up that it starts being recognised as BCM_4350C2 chip instead of Intel AX200. Only a round-trip to Windows 11 would somehow bring the chip into a state that\\nIntelBluetooth driver\\ncan work with it.\\nSonoma 14.3.1 works great on this build. But 14.4 update won\\u2019t install. It starts booting the installer and just reboots back almost immediately.\\nHence \\u2014\\nHackintosh is on its death bed\\n. Some things will work for few more months or maybe even years, depending on what you use it for and wether lack of WiFi bothers you or not. But not for me. I can live without AirDrop, Continuity and Handoff but Messages and FaceTime must work. There\\u2019re also some other things Sonoma brings that are important to me thus I want to update to it. Coupled with described lack of reliability and fretting if next minor or major update would leave me dry \\u2014 nah, not worth it.\\nI don\\u2019t really complain. I had a good run which helped me skip over the worst price/performance Mac lineup that I remember. There\\u2019re now plenty good choices within the current crop of M1 / M2 / M3 machines and I\\u2019ll be following eBay closely for a good used Mac mini / studio models. Or maybe even splurge on something new.\\nLest I forget \\u2014 if macOS Ventura works for you, stay on it! That\\u2019s still perfectly stable without a single issue across a variety of build options.\\nJust to clarify one thing, to preempt someone saying Apple did this on purpose to kill off Hackintosh:\\nthey didn\\u2019t\\n. Apple never cared about Hackintosh scene, it\\u2019s entirely irrelevant to their business. They did what they should be doing, improving the macOS codebase. It\\u2019s always a good thing to remove obsolete and deprecated code thus Apple is doing the right thing for their product.\\nAll code shown in posts is licensed under\\nMIT license\\n.

Too many words.\\nFor example, many academic papers are pages and pages of background, discussion, citations, etc.  Very often the actual new material can fit on an index card + 1 figure.  I understand why all the background is needed, in the abstract, but maybe this traditional way of thinking about incremental academic thought needs to shift in light of the reality of LLMs: LLMs will be used to write needless fluff. Indeed, it's what they're good at.\\nI'm a patent attorney and I can say that the same thing applies there.  Patents are enormous documents filled with legalese, background, description, vague, conditional language, etc.  There are good legal reasons for that, but again, often the actual novel invention can fit on an index card.\\nFor that reason, it's self-evident to me that my job will be replaced, at least to some significant extent, by LLMs.  But why not just cut out all the needless words?  I could imagine patent law that added a \\\"parsimony\\\" requirement to patent filings.  Examiners could reject filings that contained extraneous words. Then maybe patent lawyers would still be needed: to write the shortest possible patent that still contained the novelty.\\nThis is just a toy thought experiment, not a serious proposal. My point is that LLMs expose as trivially bankrupt some aspects of academic and patent writing (and probably other places: marketing copy, some nonfiction essay-style writing, etc.).\\nMaybe LLMs will force us to embrace or even require brevity and conciseness to ensure that human beings stay in the loop.\\nreply\\nqarl\\n1 hour ago\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nEven worse, I've seen evidence that many researchers will use a calculator rather than work out the math for themselves.\\nreply\\ncolanderman\\n43 minutes ago\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nIf only reading LLM-generated bullshit didn't waste the reader's time!\\nreply\\npmarreck\\n35 minutes ago\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nI don't see the issue with LLM paper assistance as long as the product is good\\nreply\\nverticalscaler\\n2 hours ago\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nVery ironically this blog post is plagiarizing a tweet without credit. ;)\\nhttps://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1768405485705650309\\nreply\\nradarsat1\\n1 hour ago\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nIronically?

Relative to farming, cleaning solar panels is a drop in the ocean. In terms of surface area, it doesn't really compare. And of course it doesn't help that people just let the excess water drain away. They pump it up, use it and, then it drains away to rivers and eventually the ocean. Instead, they could be recycling that water and using it for irrigation. But because the water is cheap, nobody cares about it. So it's drained and lost.\\nIn the Netherlands which, depending on how you look at it, is technically mostly a swamp with really awesome drainage and pumps, we have ground water shortages. Reason: farmers like irrigating their land (much of it below sea level) with ground water because it is cheap. But they also like to keep their fields well drained so their plants don't rot in the field. So they are actively draining water from their lands while using ground water to keep them at just the right level of wetness. They use massive amounts of water and the drained water is rich in phosphates and other nutrients which is causing all sorts of issues down stream.\\nNot sustainable. The climate in the Netherlands while changing is still quite wet. And besides, two of the largest rivers in Europe flow through the country. Mostly we have issues with water levels of those being way too high, not too low. In other words, there's plenty of water. Except in the ground. Getting rid of excess water is actually a major engineering challenge.\\nWater companies are also tapping into the same unsustainable sources because its cheap and doesn't need a lot of filtering because it's also clean. So there are water shortages and calls for people to use less water, irrigate their lawns and gardens less, and take shorter showers all while we are dealing with getting millions of tonnes of excess water to the North Sea.\\nreply\\nmiohtama\\n14 minutes ago\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nThis is exactly what happens in Spain:\\nhttps://www.euronews.com/green/2024/02/01/spain-expected-to-...\\nAgriculture is responsible for 80% of water use.

By 2026, more than 3 million farmers will be raising irrigation water from beneath their fields using solar-powered pumps. With effectively free water available in almost unlimited quantities to grow their crops, their lives could be transformed. Until the water runs out.\\nThe desert state of Rajasthan is the Indian pioneer and has more solar pumps than any other. Over the past decade, the government has given subsidized solar pumps to almost\\n100,000 farmers\\n. Those pumps now water more than a\\nmillion acres\\nand have enabled agricultural water use to increase by more than a\\nquarter\\n. But as a result, water tables are falling rapidly. There is little rain to replace the water being pumped to the surface. In places, the underground rocks are now dry down to 400 feet below ground.\\nThat is the effective extraction limit of the pumps, many of which now lie abandoned. To keep up, in what amounts to a race to the bottom of the diminishing reserves, richer farmers have been buying more powerful solar pumps, leaving the others high and dry or forcing them to buy water from their rich neighbors.\\nWater wipeout looms. And not just in Rajasthan.\\nThe success of solar pumps is \\u201cthreatening the viability of many aquifers already at risk of running dry,\\u201d says a World Bank economist.\\nSolar pumps are spreading rapidly among rural communities in many water-starved regions across India, Africa, and elsewhere.

Irrigation watered the \\u201cgreen revolution\\u201d of new high-yielding but thirsty crops, keeping a fast-growing world population largely fed.\\nBut many systems have reached their limits. Rivers are being emptied, and new investment has dried up. So in the past three decades, hundreds of millions of farmers in hot arid regions, from Mexico to the Middle East and South Asia, have switched to getting their water from underground.\\nBoreholes sunk into porous water-holding rocks now provide\\n43 percent\\nof the world\\u2019s irrigation water, according to a study last year by the World Bank. Irrigation is responsible for around 70 percent of the global underground water withdrawals, which are estimated at more than 200 cubic miles per year. This exceeds recharge from rainfall by nearly 70 cubic miles per year.\\nMonitoring of individual underground reserves is patchy at best. They are too often out of sight and out of mind. But a\\nstudy\\nof historical data from monitoring wells in 1,700 aquifers in 40 countries, published in January, reported that \\u201crapid and accelerating\\u201d declines in reserves were widespread.\\nScott Jasechko, a hydrologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, found water tables dropping by 3 feet or more every year in India, Iran, Afghanistan, Spain, Mexico, the United States, Chile, Saudi Arabia, and other countries.\\nAid agencies and governments subsidize solar pumps to boost food production, reduce poverty, and cut fossil fuel emissions.\\nThe implications of this for the future are profound. \\u201cGroundwater depletion is becoming a global threat to food security, yet \\u2026 remains poorly quantified,\\u201d says Meha Jain, who studies the sustainability of farming systems at the University of Michigan. But rather than calling a halt to groundwater withdrawals, policymakers are upping the ante by promoting solar power as a means of delivering yet more and cheaper underground water to fields.\\nThe solar revolution on farms is happening with the best of intentions and is using a technology widely seen as environmentally beneficial. Farmers love the fact that their photovoltaic (PV) pumps do not require expensive and polluting diesel fuel or grid connections. Once installed, they can run all day at no cost, growing more food crops, or allowing their owners to expand their businesses \\u2014 growing water-intensive cash crops, or earning income from selling spare water to neighbors. Many farmers also keep their old diesel or electric pumps to continuing pumping when the sun goes down.\\nDevelopment agencies and governments are equally keen. They subsidize solar pumps to boost food production, reduce poverty, cut emissions from fossil fuels, and curtail growing demands on overstretched electricity grids. But the long-term downside of this solar revolution looms large.\\nFarmer Mohamed Ali al-Hussein waters a watermelon patch near Hasakeh, Syria with the help of a solar-powered pump.\\nDelil Souleiman / AFP via Getty Images\\nThe crisis is particularly stark in India.

Unchecked, says Shah, solar power is set to make the situation worse.\\nSub-Saharan Africa could soon be on the same path. Shallow groundwater is present below fields in many places across the continent. But the cost of buying diesel fuel is prohibitively high for many farmers, and most rural areas are not connected to electricity grids.

But Falchetta calculates that in the future 11 million more could be deployed to irrigate 135 million acres of currently rainfed fields \\u2014 an area the size of France.

They have little choice if they want to grow crops as other means of pumping water to their fields falter.\\nThat is certainly the case in Yemen, on the south flank of the Arabian Peninsula, where the desert sands have a new look these days. Satellite images show around 100,000 solar panels glinting in the sun, surrounded by green fields. Hooked to water pumps, the panels provide free energy for farmers to pump out ancient underground water. They are irrigating crops of\\nqat\\n, a shrub whose narcotic leaves are the country\\u2019s stimulant of choice, chewed through the day by millions of men.\\nFor these farmers, the solar irrigation revolution in Yemen is born of necessity. Most crops will only grow if irrigated, and the country\\u2019s long civil war has crashed the country\\u2019s electricity grid and made supplies of diesel fuel for pumps expensive and unreliable. So, they are turning\\nen masse\\nto solar power to keep the\\nqat\\ncoming.\\nThe panels have proved an instant hit, says Middle East development researcher Helen Lackner of SOAS University of London. Everybody wants one. But in the hydrological free-for-all, the region\\u2019s underground water, a legacy of wetter times, is running out.\\nThe solar-powered farms are pumping so hard that they have triggered \\u201ca significant drop in groundwater since 2018 \\u2026 in spite of above average rainfall,\\u201d according to an\\nanalysis\\nby Leonie Nimmo, a researcher until recently at the U.K.-based Conflict and Environment Observatory. The spread of solar power in Yemen \\u201chas become an essential and life-saving source of power,\\u201d both to irrigate food crops and provide income from selling qat, he says, but it is also \\u201crapidly exhausting the country\\u2019s scarce groundwater reserves.\\u201d\\nFarmers often use their solar pumps to supplement existing diesel-powered pumps, rather than replacing them.\\nIn the central Sana\\u2019a Basin, Yemen\\u2019s agricultural heartland, more than 30 percent of farmers use solar pumps. In a\\nreport\\nwith Musaed Aklan, a water researcher at the Sana\\u2019a Center for Strategic Studies, Lackner predicts a \\u201ccomplete shift\\u201d to solar by 2028. But the basin may be down to its last few years of extractable water. Farmers who once found water at depths of 100 feet or less are now\\npumping\\nfrom 1,300 feet or more.\\nSome 1,500 miles to the northeast, in in the desert province of Helmand in Afghanistan, more than 60,000 opium farmers have in the past few years given up on malfunctioning state irrigation canals and switched to\\ntapping\\nunderground water using solar water pumps. As a consequence, water tables have been falling typically by 10 feet per year, according to David Mansfield, an expert on the country\\u2019s opium industry from the London School of Economics.\\nAn abrupt ban on opium production imposed by Afghanistan\\u2019s Taliban rulers in 2022 may offer a partial reprieve. But the wheat that the farmers are growing as a replacement is also a thirsty crop. So, water bankruptcy in Helmand may only be delayed.\\nWater pours from a solar-powered pump near Sana'a, Yemen.\\nMohammed Mohammed / Xinhua / Alamy Stock Photo\\n\\u201cVery little is known about the aquifer [in Helmand], its recharge or when and if it might run dry,\\u201d according to Mansfield. But if their pumps run dry, many of the million-plus people in the desert province could be left destitute, as this vital desert resource \\u2014 the legacy of rainfall in wetter times \\u2014 disappears for good.\\nEven the potential climate benefits of solar pumping may prove illusory, says the World Bank\\u2019s Balasubramanya. In theory, switching from diesel or electricity to PV pumping should eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. But in practice, farmers often use their solar pumps to supplement existing pumps, rather than replacing them. And, however it is pumped, the extra water available will also encourage farmers to adopt more intensive farming methods, using more fertilizer and machinery to grow thirstier cash crops, increasing the carbon footprint of the farm.\\nWhat is to be done? Groundwaters are notoriously hard to police. India\\u2019s overpumping has been \\u201ca colossal anarchy,\\u201d says Shah. Some states have attempted to control non-solar pumps that run on grid electricity by restricting power supplies to farmers to a few hours every day. It had some effect, says Shah, who first proposed the idea. But many farmers responded by buying more powerful pumps.\\nWhatever the technology, \\u201cif the cost of pumping is zero, then people will pump unless some restriction is put on them.\\u201d\\nNow, to combat the excesses of solar pumps, Gujarat state has been paying some farmers high prices to use their PV panels to send power to the grid, rather than pump water, making solar energy in effect a new cash crop.\\nThe pilot project was limited to just 4,300 wells, and again the benefit was \\u201cmuted,\\u201d says Shah. He believes a better designed scheme could work. But Balasubramanya, who until recently worked with Shah in India, is doubtful. She warns that it might simply encourage more farmers to invest in solar panels, which could end up increasing water pumping further.\\nIn any case, controls based around the electricity grid will not work in rural Africa, where there is rarely any grid for farmers to either tap into or supply.\\nMORE ON YALE E360\\nAfter the storm, Malawi\\u2019s farmers face a precarious future.\\nRead more\\n.\\nNone of this should be seen as a condemnation of solar power, says Balasubramanya. \\u201cThe fundamental problem is not the solar technology itself.\\u201d Whatever the technology, \\u201cif the cost of pumping is zero, then people will pump unless some restriction is put on them.\\u201d\\nBut Balasubramanya says technology could come to the rescue.

Still 100% talking about hardware at the bottom and end user applications at the other end. But there is no discussion of the platform which to me is actually the highest value proposition Apple is bringing here.\\nIn short: Apple has made a fully realized spatial operating system, while Meta has made an app launcher for immersive Unity/Unreal apps for vanilla Android. You can get away with an app launcher when all you want to support is fully immersive apps that don't talk to each other. But that fails completely if you are trying to build a true operating system.\\nThink about what has to exist, to say, intelligently copy and paste parts of a 3D object made by one application into a 3D object made by another, the same way you would copy a flat image from photoshop into a Word document. The operating system has to truly understand 3D concepts internally. Meta\\nis\\nbuilding these features but it is stuck in a really weird space trying to wedge them in between Android underneath and Unity/Unreal at the application layer. Apple has had the advantage of green field engineering it exactly how they want it to be from the ground up.\\nreply\\nrldjbpin\\n25 minutes ago\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nit is high time to stop praising apple for their software ecosystem. i am still impressed by their level of engineering but it is not doing much in terms of real use-case since the ios days.\\ncase in point - the whole ipad and \\\"what is a computer\\\" campaign. it is hilarious when a half-baked mouse support is celebrated in a tablet. despite using similar hardware, apple refuses to treat their tablets up to their true potential.\\ndespite working on an RTOS for avp, there is no signs that the headset stack will be exploitable by professionals, like it used to for macs. for the coming future it will remain to be a good software demo built on top of nice displays.\\nreply\\nlynndotpy\\n1 day ago\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nFor me personally, it's definitely the platform.

If you bought a device which allowed you to buy apps, the experience would be horrible without an account. If most people are willing and it's a better experience, it makes sense to force everyone into the same rails to reduce implementation cost. If it increases revenue, there's yet another reason to do it. It's ridiculous to be in an ideological minority and expect a company to bend to that when it's not in their best interest.\\nWhile I prefer Apple products because <yada yada>, Meta and Apple are doing the same thing here.

It was wrong as a broad statement twenty years ago, and such a statement I would hazard is still wrong now.\\nI've had a twenty year career in IT. Starting with PC repair and working for a PC OEM, however the vast majority of my career has been spent in fields involving Linux. (Linux Administrator/Systems Engineering/DevOPS through to executive leadership). I know how computers work, I know how the hardware works, I know the relative value of parts that go into things, yes I can, always have, and still will build machines including using on a regular basis all major operating systems in place today and despite all of this, I still remain an Apple customer and its not because im some dumbo non technical individual tricked by apples fancy marketing voodoo.\\nIt's because for those twenty years Apple has consistently conducted themselves in a way with\\nme\\npersonally that for the vast majority of cases, has served\\nme\\nbest as a user and as their customer. As opposed to some third party who is paying them to exploit me through their operating system or some mass of adware shipped with their operating system, not just this years profit margins, not just for as long as im in the store and to which afterwards im left alone once ive paid them with a \\\"fuck you, got mine.\\\"\\nJust a few of the events of the past twenty years that have kept me as an apple customer:\\n* 2006ish era macbook. HDD dies at random just outside of warranty. No local apple stores at the time. Local authorised repairer spends two weeks dicking me around on a fix, nothing. I push it to Apple who was not even local at the time. A week later I have a\\nBRAND NEW\\nmacbook, not just a drive, outside of warranty, complete with brand new warranty, an additional year tacked on top and an apology for the service I had received. (We now have apple stores so this would not occur again I imagine.)\\n* 2014ish iPhone. Much like the macbook I start having issues outside of warranty, it is unable to be debugged in store. Dude wanders away, comes back. \\\"Have you got a backup?\\\", \\\"Yes?\\\", \\\"We'll just give you a refurb, newer model, with warranty, are you happy with that?\\\" \\\"lol, yes I am.\\\"\\n* 2012 15\\\" MacBook pro retina battery replacement - Battery dies outside of warranty in around 2017 and im informed no stock currently exists in the country, and that i'll be waiting months if I wanted a replacement. I am immediately informed that if I do not want to wait, I can instead have a significantly more powerful, and higher specced refurb model, complete with brand new warranty in place of waiting the month for a replacement. I took the replacement. Again, this machine was OUTSIDE of the warranty window. That one retina MBP purchase due to this replacement saw my laptop needs covered for a decade.\\nThis is only touching on a tiny amount of the circumstances that have led to me remaining to continue investigating the purchase of products from Apple. Not everyone will have had these interactions, or come away from Apple positively, and perhaps one day, I also will not and my opinions will change. But at this point, from the day I became a customer through now, I have received a better long term support experience as a customer from Apple, then I have from any other organisation on the planet.\\nreply\\nhnfong\\n1 day ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\n> > Are their products more reliable, more fully featured, and objectivley better than their competitiors?

Sure, they price things at a point where they can afford to make a quality product, but it's more than that... There are times when things aren't perfect, but overall everything works together and is very high quality. When I've tried in the past to buy non-Apple gear, things tend to be clunky, incomplete, and put a high burden on me as a user, even in cases where the specs might be better than Apple gear.\\nreply\\ngeneralizations\\n1 day ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nBecause they're able to understand what is actually valuable to their customers, and they'll go the extra mile to make sure that what matters is done properly.\\nIt's comparable to why 'Google Video Search' lost out to youtube way back in the day. The google engineer nerds couldn't understand why no one liked their product: it had all these options for uploading video with the best quality and all these formats, while youtube had worse quality and few options. They missed the point and didn't understand the users, and were caught up in the tech rather than what was actually valuable to the users (basically: dead simple to 'just upload a video' - quality doesn't matter as much as that).\\nKinda like how Mark Z. has been talking about how the Oculus has similar resolution. It's not the tech specs that make the product - those are necessary but not sufficient. If the product is supposed to be AR: then it needs to actually be AR. And that means. e.g., that details like virtual shadows on real surfaces MUST be included, and must actually work properly. If it's not, then it's only kinda-AR. That's the kind of long tail that Apple understands, and other companies don't. The tech must fit the users, and the experience must be complete.\\nreply\\nnerdjon\\n1 day ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nI think Apple is in a unique situation.\\nFirst, we cannot ignore Apple Fanboys (and I am not using that in a negative sense). They have a large base of users who will jump at nearly anything they put out.\\nHowever they also have a track record of doing things, both big and small, and pushing the industry to go a certain way. Dropping CD drives is a great example of this, this was an inevitability with more and more distribution through the internet. This would be a risk for a manufacture to try with a random computer because consumers may just ignore it. Apple has the power to say, well you want a Mac? here are your couple options and we are doing this anyways.\\nSometimes this fails, see all USB-C Laptops.\\nBut I think it also often comes from thinking about the entire experience. Take them removing the head phone jack (the debate on whether or not they actually needed to do that aside), at the same time we got the AirPods.\\nOr the iPhone wasn't just simply, without a physical keyboard. It emphasized the advantages of this throughout the entire OS.\\nBut regardless of all the above, I think the simple fact that they just happen to generally sell a lot of devices. Enough that it can normalize a decision for consumers and then other manufactures can follow without risk.\\nreply\\nquitit\\n1 day ago\\n|\\nroot\\n|\\nparent\\n|\\nprev\\n|\\nnext\\n[\\u2013]\\nIt\\u2019s because the majority of tech firms with sufficient capital are not willing to invest in the development of a full product, nor frankly, do they have the leadership to do so.

Some also do this because they see the product as a threat to their core business.\\nThere will also be various cheerleaders who exalt that apple\\u2019s ideas are trivially obvious and were always the pre-destined pathway for the category.

They get all of the iOS media and peripheral handling capability \\\"for free\\\". Both projects can focus on TV or speaker features since the base OS is largely a solved problem for them. If they need some special consideration from somewhere in SWE they just file a Radar. They don't just get binary blob dumps of firmware from outside vendors and have to beg for bug fixes and hope their contract is big enough to get some consideration.\\nThe Vision Pro leverages their ARM SoCs, base OS, and all the motion coprocessors that have been in their phones and watches for a decade. Novel improvements from the Vision Pro's development will just feed back to those components and make it into the next phone, watch, or whatever.\\nMost other companies don't actually own their whole product stack. Even Microsoft is at the mercy of their suppliers with the Surface line. They get what Intel, NVIDIA, and AMD have to offer.

Inspired by my dear friend\\nMatt Mullenweg\\u2019s 40th post\\n, I decided to put pen to paper.\\nThis started as a blog post and became an essay before too long, so I\\u2019ve structured my writing in multiple sections each with a clear lead to make it a bit easier to digest \\u2014 peppered with my own \\u2018takes\\u2019. I\\u2019ve tried to stick to original thoughts for the most part and link to what others have said where applicable.\\nSome of the topics I touch on:\\nWhy I believe Vision Pro may be an over-engineered \\u201cdevkit\\u201d\\nThe genius & audacity behind some of Apple\\u2019s hardware decisions\\nGaze & pinch\\nis an incredible UI superpower and major industry ah-ha moment\\nWhy the Vision Pro software/content story is so dull and unimaginative\\nWhy most people won\\u2019t use Vision Pro for watching TV/movies\\nApple\\u2019s bet in immersive video is a total game-changer for\\nLive Sports\\nWhy I returned my Vision Pro\\u2026 and my Top 10 wishlist to reconsider\\nApple\\u2019s VR debut is the best thing that ever happened to Oculus/Meta\\nMy unsolicited product advice to Meta for\\nQuest Pro 2\\nand beyond\\nThe Apple Vision Pro is the Northstar the VR industry needed, whether we admit it or not\\nI\\u2019ve been a VR enthusiast for most of my adult life, from working as an intern at\\nDisney Quest VR\\nin the 1990s, to being an early backer of the\\nOculus Rift DK1 on Kickstarter\\nin 2013, to leading the Oculus VR/AR team at Meta from 2017 to 2020 (and getting to work alongside VR legends like John Carmack, Brendan Iribe and Jason Rubin), and always testing every VR product or experience I can get my hands on.\\nBack in my Oculus days, I used to semi-seriously joke with our team (and usually got a lot of heat for it!) that the best thing that could ever happen to us was having Apple enter the VR industry and become a direct competitor to Oculus. I\\u2019ve always believed that strong competition pushes a team to do their best work in any industry. This became clear to me especially after living for nearly 10 years at the center of the iOS/Android battle of ecosystems where each side made the other infinitely better by constantly raising the bar on UX, features, performance, developer APIs etc, and seeing each side respond by not only fast following but usually also improving on what the other had released. (And this definitely went both ways: iOS copied Android as much as Android copied iOS).\\nBut in the case of VR at Oculus, we also never really felt like the world had a Northstar that could truly capture human hearts and minds, and without that it would be impossible to transition VR from being a niche gamer tech to the incredible spatial computing paradigm that we always thought it potentially represented (which I still very much believe in). Apple could\\nreally\\nhelp us if they cared about VR.\\nThe Vision Pro launch has more or less done exactly what I had always hoped for, which is to build a huge wave of awareness and curiosity that elevates the spatial computing ecosystem and could ultimately lead to mass-market consumer demand and a lot more developer interest than VR has ever had. Now it\\u2019s up to the industry to create enough user value and demonstrate whether this is in fact the future of computing.\\nThe Vision Pro\\u2019s\\ninstant magic\\ncomes down to just: (1) an unprecedented new level of presence in VR, and (2) a new UI superpower using\\ngaze & pinch\\nUsing Vision Pro is an instantly magical and intuitive experience \\u2014 whether or not you\\u2019ve used other VR headsets \\u2014 purely because of Apple\\u2019s unrelenting focus on delivering two specific capabilities that speak to our humanity:\\n1) Feeling present and connected to your physical world\\n: thanks to a high-fidelity passthrough (\\u201cmixed reality\\u201d) experience with very low latency, excellent distortion correction (\\nmuch\\nbetter than Quest 3), and sufficiently high resolution that allows you to even see your phone/computer screen through the passthrough cameras (i.e. without taking your headset off).\\nEven though there are major gaps left to be filled in future versions of the Vision Pro hardware (which I\\u2019ll get into later), this level of connection with the real world \\u2014 or \\u201cpresence\\u201d as VR folks like to call it \\u2014 is something that no other VR headset has ever come even close to delivering and so far was only remotely possible with AR headsets (ex: HoloLens and Magic Leap) which feature physically transparent displays but have their own significant limitations in many other areas. Apple\\u2019s implementation of Optic ID as an overlay on top of live passthrough is a beautiful design decision that only enhances this sense of presence.\\nMY TAKE:\\nThe Vision Pro high-fidelity passthrough experience parallels\\nApple\\u2019s introduction of the iPhone\\u2019s original\\nretina display\\n, which set a new experience bar and gold standard in mobile display fidelity. While much remains to be improved in the Vision Pro passthrough experience, Apple is unquestionably setting a new standard for all future headsets (by any vendor) that VR passthrough must be good enough to closely resemble reality.\\n2) Having a new UI superpower with gaze & pinch\\n, thanks to a very precise eye tracking system (with 2 dedicated cameras per eye) embedded into the lenses, coupled with a wide-field-of-view hand tracking system that can \\u201csee\\u201d a finger pinch even with your hands are down or resting on your lap. Because it works so effortlessly for the user, it really feels like having a new \\u201claser vision\\u201d superpower.\\nThe hardware needed to track eyes and hands in VR has been around for over a decade, and it\\u2019s Apple\\u2019s unique ability to bring everything together in a magical way that makes this UI superpower the most important achievement of the entire Vision Pro product, without a shadow of doubt.\\nMY TAKE:\\nThe Vision Pro\\u2019s new \\u201cgaze + pinch\\u201d input modality is\\nthe VR equivalent of the iPhone\\u2019s capacitive multi-touch gestures\\n. Introduced by Apple with the first iPhone launch nearly 17 years ago, multi-touch instantly became a new standard that changed computing forever. \\u201cGaze + pinch\\u201d is so groundbreaking that it\\u2019s an instant de facto standard for VR interaction that future VR headsets will be forced to adopt sooner or later. It\\u2019s also going to be a huge developer unlock that leads to gaze-based interaction ideas that will blow our minds.\\nHardware\\nVision Pro is a meticulously over-engineered \\u201cdevkit\\u201d that is\\nfar too heavy\\nto have product-market fit\\nbut good enough to seed curiosity into the world\\nThe Oculus VR story began with the 2013 launch of\\nOculus Rift DK1\\n(short for \\u201cdevkit v1\\u201d or \\u201cdevelopment kit v1\\u201d). This was a headset launched by the original Oculus startup team \\u2014 years before it was acquired by Facebook \\u2014 with the explicit goal of seeding developer interest well before a commercial release. Given that VR was a non-existing market then, releasing a devkit was the correct and necessary strategy\\nthere and then\\nfor a startup to start building a content library as well as momentum among enthusiasts ahead of launching a consumer product. The team released a\\nDK2\\nabout a year later in 2014, and finally launched the first Oculus Rift consumer headset in 2015.\\nOculus co-founder Palmer Luckey wearing the original Oculus Rift DK1 released in 2013\\nWhen I joined Facebook to lead the Oculus team in 2017 after the acquisition, one of the many battles I found myself in the middle of almost immediately was the \\u201cdevkit war\\u201d. The Oculus team\\u2019s DK1 and DK2 legacy was so strong that it was not uncommon to hear arguments in product meetings pushing for us to launch VR headsets still in prototype stage as \\u201cdevkits\\u201d to end users. Since Oculus was no longer a startup \\u2014 and had the resources to both extensively test prototypes without launching them as products\\nand\\nrun extensive pre-launch developer programs \\u2014 it no longer made sense for Oculus devkits to exist. This stance often didn\\u2019t make me very popular amongst some of my Oculus OG colleagues.\\nFast forward to 2024. After the Vision Pro launch, the VR hardware enthusiast community (including Oculus OG folks I\\u2019m still in touch with) quickly arrived at the conclusion that Apple really played it safe in the design of this first VR product by over-engineering it. For starters, Vision Pro ships with more sensors than what\\u2019s likely necessary to deliver Apple\\u2019s intended experience. This is typical in a first-generation product that\\u2019s been under development for so many years. It makes Vision Pro start to feel like a devkit.\\nA sensor party: 6 tracking cameras, 2 passthrough cameras, 2 depth sensors\\n(plus 4 eye-tracking cameras not shown)\\nHere\\u2019s a quick comparison with existing VR headsets:\\nSensor\\nVision Pro\\nMeta\\nQuest 3\\nMeta\\nQuest Pro\\nEnvironment passthrough cameras\\n2\\n2\\n1\\nWorld tracking cameras\\n6\\n4\\n6\\nDepth sensors\\n2\\n1\\n\\u2013\\nEye tracking cameras\\n4\\n\\u2013\\n2\\nTotal\\n14\\n7\\n9\\nSide-by-side comparison with the sensor stacks of other VR headsets\\nThis over-spec\\u2019ing is unsurprising and characteristic of a v1 product where its creator wants to ensure it survives the hardest tests early users will no doubt want to put the product through. It\\u2019s also a way for Apple to see how far developers will push the product\\u2019s capabilities, as Apple is no doubt relying on that community to produce the majority of software/content magic for this new type of computer, as they\\u2019ve previously done with every other device class.\\nApple\\u2019s decision to over-spec the Vision Pro does, however, lead to the inevitable consequence of a headset weighing above 600g \\u2014 heavier than most other VR headsets in the market to date \\u2014 that\\nmakes it difficult for most people to wear it for more than 30-45 minutes at a time without suffering a lot of discomfort\\n. Most of the discomfort comes in the form of pressure against the user\\u2019s face and the back of the person\\u2019s head.\\nMY TAKE:\\nBecause of its heavy weight, Vision Pro has inevitably landed in the world as a high-quality \\u201cdevkit\\u201d designed to capture everyone\\u2019s curiosity, hearts & minds with its magic (especially through the voice of enthusiastic tech influencers) while being realistically focused on developers as its primary audience. In other words, the Vision Pro is a devkit that helps prepare the world to receive a more mainstream Apple VR headset that could have product-market fit in 1 or 2 generations.\\nAll things considered, I do believe Apple\\u2019s calculus was correct in prioritizing launching a first-generation product with fewer experience and design compromises at the expense of user comfort. And while many people have argued Apple could have avoided this major comfort issue by redistributing weight or using lighter materials, those attempts would have come at the expense of beauty and design. (I\\u2019ll come back to the weight issue shortly.)\\nWith this in mind, it\\u2019s easy to understand two particularly important decisions Apple made for the Vision Pro launch:\\nDesigning an incredible in-store Vision Pro demo experience\\n, with the primary goal of getting as many people as possible to experience the magic of VR through Apple\\u2019s lenses \\u2014 most of whom have no intention to even consider a $4,000 purchase. The demo is only secondarily focused on actually selling Vision Pro headsets.\\nLaunching an iconic woven strap that photographs beautifully\\neven though this strap simply isn\\u2019t comfortable enough for the vast majority of head shapes. It\\u2019s easy to conclude that this decision paid off because nearly every bit of media coverage (including and especially third-party reviews on YouTube) uses the woven strap despite the fact that it\\u2019s less comfortable than the dual loop strap that\\u2019s \\u201chidden in the box\\u201d.\\nThe existence of Vision Pro in 2024 is entirely a function of Apple managing to ship a\\nfirst-of-its-kind\\nultra\\nhigh-resolution display\\nOne of our biggest product positioning struggles within the Oculus VR team from the very beginning \\u2014 especially when trying to convince reviewers \\u2014 was always related to having\\nunderwhelming displays\\n. Every single Oculus headset that ever shipped (including the latest Quest 3) has suffered from resolution/pixelation issues varying from \\u201cterrible\\u201d to \\u201cpretty bad\\u201d. It\\u2019s like we\\u2019re living in the VR-equivalent world of VGA computer monitors.\\nMY TAKE:\\nIn order For Apple to make a huge splash entering the VR market \\u2014 a category that\\u2019s been around the consumer world for nearly 10 years \\u2014 they needed to launch a product that was unambiguously better than anything that had ever existed. The obvious way to do that was to\\nattack the Achilles heel of all existing headsets and reinvent the VR display\\n, and that\\u2019s exactly what Apple did with the Vision Pro.\\nVision Pro is the first VR headset that offers good enough resolution and visual acuity with little semblance of a\\nscreen door effect\\nor pixelation artifacts. This level of presence and fidelity could only be made possible with an ultra high-res display, and it\\u2019s 100% clear that achieving a first-of-its-kind level of display quality was the internal launch bar for Vision Pro at Apple.\\nApple\\u2019s relentless and uncompromising hardware insanity is largely what made it possible for such a high-res display to exist in a VR headset, and it\\u2019s clear that this product couldn\\u2019t possibly have launched much sooner than 2024 for one simple limiting factor \\u2014 the maturity of micro-OLED displays plus the existence of power-efficient chipsets that can deliver the heavy compute required to drive this kind of display (i.e. the M2).\\nMicro-OLED displays differ from any other previous consumer display technology because they are manufactured on top of a silicon substrate (similar to how semiconductor chips are made). To put the insanity of micro-OLED displays in perspective, the\\nVision Pro panel has a 7.4x higher pixel density than the latest iPhone and nearly 3x the Quest 3\\n:\\nFeature\\nVision Pro\\nBigscreen Beyond\\nQuest 3\\niPhone 15 Pro Max\\nDisplay Type\\nMicro-OLED\\nMicro-OLED\\nLCD\\nOLED\\nResolution\\n(pixels per eye)\\n3660 x 3200\\n2560 x 2560\\n2064 x 2208\\n2796 x 1290\\nTotal Pixels\\n23 million\\n13 million\\n9 million\\n3.6 million\\nPixels Per Inch (PPI)\\n3386\\n(unknown)\\n1218\\n460\\nPixels Per Degree (PPD)\\n34\\n32\\n25\\n94\\n(at 1 foot distance)\\n(See the appendix of this essay for a quick explanation of\\nPixels Per Degree\\nor\\nPPD\\n)\\nThe folks at iFixit created this stunning GIF using a scientific microscope to compare the pixel size of the Vision Pro display \\u2014 which measures 7.5 \\u03bcm, the size of a human red blood cell \\u2014 with the pixel size of the latest iPad and iPhone displays:\\nSource:\\niFixit\\nThe Apple Vision Pro\\u2019s micro-OLED display has created a lot of chatter in my hardware supply chain world, with lots of companies \\u2014 predominantly smartphone OEMs \\u2014 quickly racing to try and build a product that can deliver a similar experience to Vision Pro. Apple has secured a 1-year exclusive with\\nSony Semiconductor Solutions Group\\nand its second supplier\\nSeeYA Technology\\n. There are also rumors Apple is dropping Sony as a display supplier and replacing it with\\nBOE\\n(whose\\nwebsite\\nsays a panel equivalent to Vision Pro is at \\u201csample\\u201d stage).\\nMY TAKE:\\nI fully expect the\\nrecently announced Meta/LG partnership\\nto be all about creating a supply chain advantage for Meta so they can race a\\nQuest Pro 2\\nproduct into market that can compete with Vision Pro with LG putting some skin in the game to lower the street price of the headset.\\n(P.S. For anyone who wants to dig into more details of the Vision Pro display and pass-through system, I highly recommend\\nthis article from iFixit\\nand\\nthis article from Karl Guttag\\n, who\\u2019s an amazingly talented expert in display devices).\\nApple made the Vision Pro display\\nintentionally blurry\\nin order to hide pixelation artifacts and make graphics appear smoother\\nThere is a very good reason Apple has not used the word\\nretina\\nanywhere in their marketing materials for Vision Pro. It\\u2019s the simple fact that Vision Pro\\u2019s display does not pass the retina test \\u2014 which is a\\nresolution high enough that the human eye can no longer discern individual pixels\\n. The Vision Pro display is nowhere near retina quality for a VR headset (see appendix for details) and yet\\nour eyes cannot see individual pixels when looking at it\\n. What gives?\\nDuring the first few days using Vision Pro, there was something that kept calling my attention but which I struggled to get my arms (or eyes) around. Everything my eyes saw in the headset felt a bit softer than I expected, and I initially attributed this to the seemingly refreshing absence of any\\nscreen door effect\\n\\u2014 a pixelation artifact that has essentially doomed all VR headsets created up until now.\\nWell, as it turns out, the incredible\\nKarl Guttag\\nran a meticulous\\nphotographic analysis of the Vision Pro display\\nand came to a curious and possibly disturbing conclusion:\\nApple\\nintentionally calibrated the Vision Pro display slightly out of focus\\nto make pixels a bit blurry and hide the screen door effect \\u201cin plain sight\\u201d\\n.\\nThis image from Karl\\u2019s blog explains this well by comparing Vision Pro and Quest 3 displays side by side at a close enough distance where it\\u2019s possible to see individual pixels and clearly see the intentional blur that was added to the Vision Pro display:\\nExtreme close-up comparison between Vision Pro (AVP) and Quest 3 (MQ3) displays (Source:\\nKGOnTech\\n)\\nWhat Karl concluded is that even though Quest 3 has a much lower display resolution than Vision Pro (1,218 PPI vs. 3,386 PPI), Quest 3 appears objectively crisper especially when showing high-contrast graphics. In other words, Quest 3 is squeezing the highest possible resolution out of its display at the expense of a \\u201charsher look\\u201d while Apple is giving up some of the Vision Pro\\u2019s display resolution in order to achieve a \\u201csofter look\\u201d. Karl may disagree with my conclusion on this point:\\nMY TAKE:\\nIntentionally making the Vision Pro optics blurry is a clever move by Apple because it results in way smoother graphics across the board by hiding the screen door effect (which in practice means that you won\\u2019t see pixelation artifacts). This is also where Apple\\u2019s \\u201ctaste\\u201d comes in, essentially resulting in the Vision Pro display being tuned to have a unique, softer, and more refined aesthetic than Quest 3 (or any other VR headsets). This is certainly a refreshing approach to designing VR hardware.\\nWith this design decision, Apple is no doubt giving up a bit of the Vision Pro display\\u2019s high pixel resolution in order to achieve overall smoother graphics. You are definitely losing some text crispness in order to gain a higher perception of quality for images, video and 3D animations. This is a big benefit of starting with an ultra high-resolution micro-OLED display \\u2014 Apple had enough pixels to work with that they could afford to make this trade-off.\\nThis is the kind of thing that our hardcore VR engineers at Oculus would have fought against to the end of the world, and I doubt we could have ever shipped a \\u201cblurred headset\\u201d, LOL!\\nSadly, the Vision Pro display suffers from\\nsignificant motion blur & image quality issues\\nthat render passthrough mode unusable for longer periods\\nWhile Apple\\u2019s decision to make individual pixels blurry on the Vision Pro display was extremely clever, the headset unfortunately suffers from a completely different type of blur that\\u2019s extremely problematic for the overall experience.\\nFrom the very first time I put on my Vision Pro, I noticed\\na lot of motion blur in passthrough\\nmode even in excellent ambient lighting conditions and a still noticeable amount even when viewing immersive content. While my immediate instinct was to think that all VR headsets have that kind of motion blur and it\\u2019s just more noticeable on Vision Pro, a side-by-side comparison with Quest 3 quickly proved it\\u2019s significantly more serious on Vision Pro. This is particularly surprising considering that the passthrough cameras and display are both running at 90 hertz.\\nSince none of the initial Vision Pro reviews pointed out this issue, I ended up even calling Apple support to find out if this might be a known problem or possibly even a hardware defect. But then more in-depth reviews began pointing out the same problem (I highly recommend\\nthis review by Snazzy Labs\\n).\\nMotion blur in passthrough mode ended up being one of the many reasons why I decided to return my Vision Pro, because it\\u2019s just uncomfortable, leads to unnecessary eye strain, and really gets in the way of anyone using the headset for longer periods of time in passthrough mode.\\nThere are other noticeable issues as well which affect passthrough mode, including\\nvery little dynamic range, incorrect white balance in most indoor use cases, and signs of edge distortion and chromatic aberration\\n. Some of these might be addressed by software updates, but I expect most will not as they probably are limitations of the hardware stack.\\nThe Vision Pro packs\\na lot more computing power\\nthan most people might realize \\u2014 the M2 + R1 combination puts it at the level of a MacBook Pro\\nAny standalone VR headset is basically a 2-in-1 system: a regular \\u201ccomputing\\u201d computer and a spatial computer bundled together.\\nA\\nregular computer\\nin charge of running applications and performing general computation\\n: this is everything that happens on your smartphone, tablet or notebook, including running the OS, executing applications across CPU/GPU loads, and doing computation work in the background.\\nA\\nspatial computer\\nin charge of the environment\\n: it keeps track of the whole environment, tracks your hands & eyes, and ensures that everything \\u2014 your surroundings, the OS system UI, and your apps \\u2014 gets rendered in the right physical place in space and updated at 90 to 120 times per second while your head and body are moving around.\\nThese two \\u201ccomputers\\u201d must operate together without missing a beat \\u2014 any latency above 20 milliseconds becomes quickly noticeable in VR and will often translate very quickly into user perception of unresponsiveness or jankiness, which can cause discomfort, eye strain or even dizziness for many people.\\nEnter the Vision Pro dual-chip design:\\n\\u201c\\nA unique dual\\u2011chip design enables the spatial experiences on Apple Vision Pro. The powerful M2 chip simultaneously runs visionOS, executes advanced computer vision algorithms, and delivers stunning graphics, all with incredible efficiency. And the brand-new R1 chip is specifically dedicated to process input from the cameras, sensors, and microphones, streaming images to the displays within 12 milliseconds \\u2014 for a virtually lag-free, real-time view of the world.\\n\\u201c\\nApple Vision Pro website\\nThe Vision Pro ships with the same M2 chip as the 2022 iPad Pro (or 2022 MacBook Air) alongside the new R1 chip which handles the massive amount of data coming from the 20+ tracking cameras and depth sensors (sensor fusion). What\\u2019s interesting to note is that Vision Pro actually does perform largely like an iPad Pro in benchmark tests that push CPU and GPU to their limits in both single-core and multi-core scenarios (see chart below).\\nSource:\\nPC Magazine\\nThis is more impressive than it seems, and demonstrates that the R1 chip is doing a very significant amount of heavy lifting \\u2014 essentially the vast majority of the spatial computing workload \\u2014 leaving a lot of compute room for the M2 chip to deliver the same level of performance as if it was just running inside an iPad Pro.\\nBy all accounts so far, the R1 chip appears to be of a fairly similar package size as the M2 chip (though built using a specialized architecture), which puts the Vision Pro well ahead of any current generation iPad or MacBook Air, and likely more on par with a MacBook Pro from a silicon performance perspective. Definitely an impressive achievement by the Apple Silicon team.\\nThis also begs the question\\u2026 what if you could completely offload the Vision Pro\\u2019s compute to another Apple device?\\nApple\\u2019s decision to use a tethered pack\\nwill\\nenable future Vision headsets to be much lighter\\nby offloading compute to an iPhone, iPad or MacBook\\nOne of the most controversial aspects of Vision Pro is the fact that it sports a tethered battery pack, differently from all other commercially available standalone VR headsets. Many people have heavily criticized Apple for this decision because of the inconvenience of the \\u201changing\\u201d external battery.\\nI agree with Palmer Luckey (\\nfrom his recent interview with Peter Diamandis\\n) that this was a necessary short-term decision on Apple\\u2019s part given the reality of the hardware shipping inside the Vision Pro, but more importantly it was a very intentional long-term decision, which I\\u2019ll explain.\\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Vision is a meticulously over-engineered computer with a very significant collection of power-hungry components:\\n2x laptop-class processors (the R1 chip is almost the same size as the M2, which is the same processor shipping on MacBooks)\\n2x very bright micro-OLED displays with high pixel density\\n1x auxiliary EyeSight display\\n12x cameras and other sensors\\n2x blower fans\\n2x speakers\\nAs Quin from Snazzy Labs carefully explains\\nin his excellent review\\n, the Vision Pro likely draws as much as\\n40 watts of power\\n, which is more than most MacBook laptops. This also means it has a power supply with the potential of generating a lot of heat. So, in addition to transferring the battery weight out of the headset, the decision to move to a tethered pack also keeps a huge heat source safely away from your head.\\nMY TAKE:\\nAll that said, the long-term strategic reason for having an external battery pack is to set expectations with Vision Pro users that there will\\nalways\\nbe an external box connected to the headset. In future Vision headsets, Apple should be able to comfortably start moving a lot of electronics off the headset, possibly shaving off as much half of the weight over a few generations and\\ntarget around 300g\\n. This also opens an extremely interesting path for Apple in a few years to\\nuse an iPhone, iPad or MacBook as the tethered computer driving the headset\\n, which would dramatically simplify the headset.\\nInterestingly, there is a tethered VR headset in the market today that demonstrates this desirable end state. It\\u2019s the\\nBigscreen Beyond\\n, the world\\u2019s smallest PC VR headset (i.e. needs to be tethered to a computer) that is lighter than even most ski goggles at 127 grams. Bigscreen\\u2019s ability to build this product is in many ways a bit of cheating since the headset was stripped of all sensors (no external cameras or eye tracking), but its existence nonetheless plays an important role in letting us experience what the future holds and where Apple\\u2019s sights are focused.\\nJohn Carmack wearing the Bigscreen Beyond VR headset,\\nwhich weighs 127g (vs. the Vision Pro\\u2019s 600g)\\nSoftware\\nThe Vision Pro software story is a\\nbold antithesis of VR\\n\\u2014 and the lack of exciting AR apps at launch paints the product into an empty corner\\n\\u201cWelcome to the era of spatial computing\\u201d\\nis Apple\\u2019s leading slogan for Vision Pro and, and as expected by everyone in the VR industry, Apple is going all-in on AR (augmented reality) to deliver on this proposition. The company has gone out of their way to actively ignore everything that VR has been known for over the last decade.\\nAt the center of Apple\\u2019s marketing for Vision Pro is\\n\\u201ckeeping users connected to their surroundings and other people\\u201d\\n. Reading in-between these lines, it\\u2019s not hard to see that Apple is taking an anti-VR stance that borderline accuses Meta\\u2019s approach to VR of promoting human isolation while positioning Vision Pro as the antithesis of that.\\nMY TAKE:\\nApple\\u2019s anti-VR stance is a risky move because it negates most of the traditional immersive content that has made the VR medium popular until now, and at least for now is painting Vision Pro into an empty corner. This reminds me of Apple\\u2019s broad\\nstance on privacy \\u2014 built to be in complete opposition to Meta/Google \\u2014 which has put them in a tight spot by severely limiting their options and restricting innovation in the age of Gen AI.\\nThere are no fully immersive games in the Vision Pro app store\\n, whereas easily >90% of the Oculus Quest catalog is made of immersive VR games. Instead of leveraging the existing community of high-quality immersive VR content developers, Apple is focusing all of its energy exclusively on AR use cases that play to the company\\u2019s ecosystem strengths \\u2014 iOS apps and MacOS productivity \\u2014 which I\\u2019ll dive into over the next few sections.\\nThe launch roster of 3D AR apps & games is a tremendous disappointment \\u2014 in both quality and quantity \\u2014 and mostly includes a few simple casual games, some of which are originally 2D games hastily converted into 3D art. The fact that\\nARKit\\nhas been available for so many years on iPad and iPhone (despite its limited success) should have made it possible for Apple to easily round up developers into building a sufficient number of exciting and impressive AR titles for Vision Pro. Instead,\\nwe\\u2019re seeing an initial lack of developer excitement for the category that should have been the\\nmost defining and inspiring category\\non Vision Pro.\\nIronically, Meta made almost exactly the same mistake launching Quest Pro in 2022. That headset shipped with close to zero AR apps despite their emphasis in the launch messaging on \\u201cfull-color mixed reality\\u201d.\\nMY TAKE\\n: This may be the first device category where Apple\\u2019s \\u201cbuild it and they will come\\u201d approach to creating developer traction may simply not work as previously. It will be many years (and possibly even more than a decade) before there are tens of millions of active Vision Pro users willing to pay for spatial AR apps. Apple will need to take a page out of the Oculus playbook and actively motivate developers financially to develop for Vision Pro.\\nVision Pro\\u2019s positioning as\\na\\nproductivity & movie watching \\u201cbig scree\\nn\\u201d\\nis dull & unimaginative\\nbut Apple is unashamedly owning it\\nWith a weak and limited launch roster of AR apps that doesn\\u2019t include a single flagship 3D app or game, Apple had to focus the entire positioning for Vision Pro at launch almost entirely on how it plugs into the existing Apple ecosystem of 2D apps.\\nIn the usual Apple-style product marketing, the launch messaging for Vision Pro is very explicitly codified in the\\nproduct webpage\\nand every single marketing asset is consistent with it. How Apple has chosen to sequence their product messaging matters just as much as the messages themselves.\\nVision Pro is 60% about 2D productivity and 40% about watching media/movies on a big screen\\n:\\nUse case\\nApple Slogans\\nProductivity\\n\\u201cFree your desktop. And your apps will follow.\\u201d\\n\\u201cHow to work\\u00a0in all\\u2011new ways.\\u201d\\nMedia\\n\\u201cThe ultimate theater. Wherever you are.\\n\\u201c\\nAn immersive way to experience entertainment.\\u201d\\nOn a side note,\\nFaceTime with Persona avatars\\nand\\nspatial photos & videos\\nare also pushed as core pillars in the Vision Pro product messaging, but they\\u2019re clearly just ancillary use cases to support marketing. Though too small to matter for now, they may (and for Apple\\u2019s sake, hopefully will) end up playing a much bigger role in the future.\\nMY TAKE:\\nThe Vision Pro launch is a significant missed opportunity, with Apple \\u201cwelcoming us into the era of spatial computing\\u201d with a software and services stack that is practically only focused on 2D use cases. Though the in-store demos paint an exciting future, the experience delivered by Apple at launch is dull and unimaginative at best.\\nPutting aside my criticism of Apple\\u2019s focus for the Vision Pro at launch, the next few sections will offer a deep dive into my thoughts and opinions on the software and experience enabling\\nProductivity\\nand\\nMedia\\nuse cases.\\nThe Vision Pro desperately wants to be\\nthe \\u201cfuture of work\\n\\u201d and pick up where Meta Quest Pro completely dropped the ball, but\\u2026\\nOne of our strongest thesis from the early Oculus days was always about VR playing a defining role in the \\u201cfuture of work\\u201d, from running 2D apps in massive virtual displays to having native 3D apps that would make it a lot easier to work and collaborate with others on a project.\\nWhen Meta announced the Quest Pro in 2022, much of its marketing hype was in fact around the\\nWorkrooms app\\n(at the time led by my incredibly talented friend Mike LeBeau). The app allows you to use your Mac from within VR, with a lot of attention to details needed to make it truly possible to work in VR for several hours, including support for up to 3 virtual monitors and the ability to see your physical keyboard in passthrough or replace it with a fully 3D rendered tracked twin.\\nImage from the Quest Pro launch marketing\\nQuest Pro was designed with the goal of being a lot more comfortable than other VR headsets so that people could wear it for longer periods of time. While this was a well-intended attempt, the product had a major flaw which made it less than a \\u201cminimum viable product\\u201d and simply did not justify a price tag well above $1,000. The display resolution \\u2014 at 22 PPD (pixels per degree) \\u2014 was too low and vastly insufficient to unlock \\u201cworking in VR\\u201d because of poor text readability. This shortcoming (in addition to very poor quality passthrough) was so massive that it rendered the product practically irrelevant at launch \\u2014 I ended up returning my unit within 24 hours of first use.\\nCan Vision Pro deliver where Quest Pro (and Quest 3) have failed?\\nIn order to really put Vision Pro to the test in real-life scenarios, I spent well over 100 hours trying to deploy as many of my own productivity workflows as I could, including about 1/3 of the work in this essay. I\\u2019ll share my conclusions over the next couple of sections.\\nFirst off, before diving into the value proposition of Vision Pro as a work/productivity computer, I needed to clearly frame my \\u201cjobs to be done\\u201d as specifically as possible. When I\\u2019m in \\u201cwork mode\\u201d \\u2014 whether doing actual professional work or just life management stuff \\u2014 I have three distinct workstations that I use back and forth (aside from my smartphone, which I won\\u2019t include here):\\nOffice workstation\\n| Mac Pro with 2x Apple XDR 6K displays:\\nmy highest productivity setup because it gives me access to everything I need in a single view and enables zero-hurdle multi-tasking; it\\u2019s basically my gold standard for any task or project no matter how complex with the highest speed & quality\\nLaptop | MacBook Pro 16-inch:\\nmedium-high productivity setup with a sufficiently large retina-quality display that still enables complex tasks with good enough multi-tasking though I do feel noticeably less productive; it requires a backpack to carry when going outside of home/office\\nTablet | iPad Pro 11-inch with keyboard:\\na low-medium productivity setup good for focused single-app work with extremely limited multi-tasking (ex. email, writing that doesn\\u2019t require research, some life planning) but still better than using my phone; one great advantage is that I can carry this \\u201cmini computer\\u201d more easily than a laptop without really needing a backpack\\nHere\\u2019s a table summarizing these workstations:\\nDevice\\nNumber of Pixels\\nNumber of simult. windows\\nIdeal for\\nErgonomics\\nPortability\\nCost\\nMac Pro + 2x XDR displays\\nXXLarge\\n(2\\u00d720 million)\\n8+\\nAny creative project with lots of multitasking\\nIdeal\\n\\u2013\\n>$10,000\\nMacBook Pro 16-inch\\nLarge\\n(7.7 million)\\n2-4\\nMost creative projects with limited multitasking\\nGood\\nMedium\\n$3,000\\niPad Pro 11-inch + keyboard case\\nMedium\\n(4 million)\\n1\\nFull email, simple editing\\nNot great\\nHigh\\n$1,200\\nI then asked myself:\\nCould I see myself using Vision Pro as a productivity device instead of (or in conjunction with) any of my existing workstations?\\nThese are the specific questions I set off to answer (from the lowest to highest bar):\\nCan Vision Pro be a complete alternative to my Tablet Workstation so that I could carry it around instead of an iPad Pro?\\nCan Vision Pro enhance my Laptop Workstation enough that it feels like having a \\u201cvirtual XDR display\\u201d or two?\\nCould Vision Pro ever be better than ALL of my workstations at least for some productivity tasks?\\n\\u21d2 This is what excites me the most!\\nProductivity Thesis #1\\n: Vision Pro as an iPad Pro replacement\\nStatus:\\n\\u274c NOT READY\\n(but it\\u2019s promising!)\\nMY TAKE:\\nThe Vision Pro aspires to become your \\u201cspatial iPad Pro\\u201d with really good potential for much better multi-tasking (than an iPad) and the ability to do focused work anywhere, but there\\u2019s simply too much usability friction and too many important apps missing for that to be a reality today (or likely in the next 1-2 years).\\nThe Vision Pro is conveniently designed by Apple to immediately fit right into the existing Apple ecosystem as a (rather expensive) alternative to an iPad Pro. The headset has identical compute (same M2 chip) to an iPad Pro and conveniently supports iPad apps running natively. In fact, it\\u2019s easy to claim the Vision Pro should in principle be better than an iPad Pro because you can run multiple iPad apps side-by-side in full screen mode, which would overcome one of the biggest productivity limitations of iPads \\u2014 poor multitasking.\\nHowever, in reality this claim really doesn\\u2019t hold true at all (at least not yet) for a few important limitations of Vision Pro at launch:\\nMany iPad apps don\\u2019t work well\\n(or at all) on Vision Pro despite\\nApple automatically opting in developers\\n. There is substantial friction and instability navigating inside productivity apps given that they\\u2019re designed for a multi-touch UI (ex: some iPad gestures don\\u2019t exist in Vision Pro, and some touch targets are too small). A lot of apps will require some effort by their developers to work well enough.\\nMost productivity apps are still missing from the App Store\\n(likely for the reason above), which would leave large holes in most people\\u2019s workflows. For example, the most important missing apps for my own workflows include Chrome, Gmail, GDocs/Sheets/Slides, Asana.\\nText input is still quite buggy\\nwhich adds more friction to any productivity workflow. Cursor placement, text selection and editing are super error prone. Dictation doesn\\u2019t stream results as you speak.\\nYou must carry a keyboard and a trackpad\\n(mice are\\nnot\\nsupported) for the vast majority of your iPad-class productivity workflows on Vision Pro, which could be an added inconvenience (compared to carrying an iPad with a keyboard case or even a laptop). Editing documents, spreadsheets or presentations without those is virtually impossible.\\nThere is no reliable workspace persistency\\nwhich adds even more friction \\u2014 you are forced to re-open apps, and then re-size and reposition windows almost every time. The capabilities we all want (which Apple should be able to ship soon if they want to) are (i) persistent workspaces, (ii) location-specific workspaces, and (iii) a spatial computing equivalent of Mission Control.\\nAll that said, these limitations can all be addressed by Apple and the potential of Vision Pro as an iPad Pro replacement really is there. Even though the iPad Pro has nearly twice the PPD (pixels per degree) as the Vision Pro, text readability of iPad apps on Vision Pro is good enough for you to run 3 or 4 side-by-side apps plus a number of ambient widgets.\\nI also really believe there\\u2019s a large enough white canvas for lots of Apple-style innovation and magic around letting users configure and manage their workspace with a combination of 2D panels and virtual 3D objects. The potential is really significant as long as Apple really empowers developers to innovate here (try\\nNicholas Jitkoff\\u2019s\\nwidget.vision\\nto see some great early examples \\u2014 the NY Times front page widget is my favorite).\\nCall me crazy, but I personally could get quite excited by the idea of a \\u201cspatial iPad Pro\\u201d\\nif I was able to actually get all of my iPad apps on the Vision Pro, and if Apple addresses all of the issues causing friction in my workflows. The reason why is simply that of focus \\u2013 to be able to really \\u201cdial down reality\\u201d and tune into the work wherever I am, without carrying my laptop with me but still having some degree of multitasking available.\\nProductivity Thesis #2\\n: Vision Pro as a MacBook virtual external monitor\\nStatus:\\n\\u2705 ALMOST READY\\n(needs some bug fixing!)\\nMY TAKE:\\nThe Vision Pro is a few software bug fixes away from being a suitable virtual-equivalent to an external monitor similar to a 27-inch Apple Studio Display that makes it easy to work immersively in VR using all your existing MacOS apps and workflows on a huge screen (but don\\u2019t expect an Apple XDR 6K experience!).\\nOne of Vision Pro\\u2019s best pieces of pure software/experience magic is the ability to seamlessly connect to a MacBook by simply looking at the computer while wearing the headset. This is a simple improvement to the traditional AirPlay UI that creates a profound sense of seamlessness which VR has always lacked.\\nBefore diving into this thesis, I\\u2019ll establish that the Vision Pro will\\nnever\\nbecome a suitable alternative for my office workstation with dual Apple XDR 6K displays. At 32 inches per-monitor and a total of 40 million pixels (with pixel density of 218 PPI and angular resolution >100 PPD) and without a weight around my head, it is simply not a bar I would hold a VR headset against today or at any point in the future.\\nThe more interesting question to focus on is whether Vision Pro could even begin to look like a suitable replacement for one or more 27-inch Apple Studio Displays (or equivalent). The short answer today is that Vision Pro can indeed come close (or very close) to that, but there are some important limitations that Apple needs to address to make this a relatively frictionless use case:\\nLack of dual (or triple) monitor support\\nis a huge bummer despite the fact that there are decent reasons for it (largely related to requiring a lot of local Wi-Fi bandwidth). Even though Vision Pro has a relatively narrow field of view that still feels like looking through binoculars, if I could get two or three virtual monitors out of a MacBook Air for example, things would start to look more interesting.\\nInconsistent keyboard and trackpad behaviors\\nmakes it very hard to switch back and forth between iPad/Vision apps and the Mac virtual display. I constantly find myself looking for my cursor, seeing the virtual keyboard pop up onscreen when clearly I don\\u2019t need it (if I\\u2019m using a physical keyboard), not to mention that I cannot use my beloved Logitech MX mouse.\\nThere is no reliable workspace persistency\\nwhich is exactly the same issue I discussed when talking about the iPad Pro use case in the previous section. This should be an easy fix.\\nEye tracking doesn\\u2019t work in MacOS\\nwhich not only leads to inconsistent input modalities as I said above but also just feels like a huge missed opportunity to offer a magical capability that MacOS has never seen before. This is not a low-hanging bug fix, but I don\\u2019t see it as a huge technical leap for Apple if the MacOS team wants to address it.\\nMacOS apps are \\u201cstuck\\u201d inside the virtual monitor\\ninstead of being allowed to move around the entire space. This is another missed opportunity to deliver a truly spatial/immersive experience with Vision Pro, though significantly more complicated for Apple to address and would require really careful engineering by both MacOS and visionOS teams.\\nMany of the issues I highlighted above are straightforward software challenges that Apple is well equipped to address and would make a world of difference. I suspect it\\u2019s a matter of dealing with the usual internal politics/collaboration challenges getting the MacOS team to dedicate the necessary resources to address bugs and feature requests from the visionOS team.\\nThe bottom line for me is that\\nwe can see a relatively near future where carrying a MacBook Air and a Vision Pro in your backpack could give you a reasonably good workstation\\n, one that delivers enough benefits in the form of productivity gains that you might be willing to wear a headset for a few hours in a caf\\u00e9, on an airplane, or even on your couch at home. (This perspective is of course made in complete absence of value-for-money considerations).\\nUnsurprisingly, this is Apple\\u2019s strongest hand with the Vision Pro launch as it\\u2019s 100% controlled by them and uniquely leverages the existing Apple ecosystem. Yes, it\\u2019s a very uninspiring and unimaginative use case, but it might be powerful enough for Apple to move a lot of headsets.\\nWatching movies in Vision Pro is great at first but most people will stop doing it after the initial novelty excitement wears off\\nWatching TV/movies in virtual reality seemed like such an incredibly compelling idea that we (the Oculus team at Meta/Facebook) built an entire product around that idea \\u2014\\nOculus Go\\n. Launched in 2018, Oculus Go was the biggest product failure I\\u2019ve ever been associated with for the simple reason that it had extremely low retention despite strong partnerships with Netflix and YouTube.\\nMost users who bought Oculus Go completely abandoned the headset after a few weeks.\\nThe full story is much more nuanced (including the fact that the Oculus Go failure got us on the path to Oculus Quest very quickly), but it taught us an important lesson.\\nThe lesson we learned is that watching traditional (rectilinear) TV or movies in VR feels incredibly compelling at first, but the novelty wears off for most people after a few weeks. The reasons are:\\nIt\\u2019s just not physically comfortable\\ncompared to watching TV or movies on an TV, tablet, or laptop, primarily because of the pressure on your head and face, plus the fact that you can\\u2019t comfortably sit in any position or lie down while wearing with the headset\\nThere\\u2019s a lot of friction\\nto start watching a video in a VR headset if you\\u2019re not already in VR \\u2014 frequently a lot more steps required (especially finding and putting on the headset) and a more cumbersome navigation UI compared to our other devices\\nIt\\u2019s socially isolating and lonely\\nto watch videos in VR, which will be a deal breaker for many people (although definitely not all)\\nBack in the Oculus Go days, we concluded rather quickly that media consumption in VR is simply not a core \\u201cdaily driver\\u201d pillar but more an ancillary use case that adds some value to other core pillars (such as productivity or gaming).\\nVision Pro does bring more to the table with a much better display than previous VR headsets which can create magical movie experiences on occasion. For instance, watching an animated Disney or Pixar movie in 3D is absolutely stunning. But the essential product-market fit challenge remains:\\nMY TAKE:\\nVR is simply not a medium people will gravitate towards for watching 2D media on a regular basis. Adding to this all of the Vision Pro\\u2019s\\ncomfort and friction issues, most people who get excited about watching media in the headset will eventually find themselves going back to their TV, tablet or laptop as their primary devices for video.\\nWatching 3D movies on Vision Pro is a fun entertainment experience, but these videos are \\u201cboxed\\u201d and don\\u2019t feel anything like witnessing real life. With the Vision Pro, Apple launched its new\\nApple Immersive\\nvideo format, which opens the door for a new class of entertainment.\\nApple Immersive Video opens a new world of possibilities for media in VR \\u2014 but its\\nhyperrealism\\nmay bring an unexpected\\nuncanny valley challenge\\nOne of the big original bets we made at Facebook/Meta with the launch of\\nOculus Go\\nin 2018 was that immersive 180-degree video would attract a massive amount of consumer interest and that this would somehow trigger a chain reaction in the world of entertainment. We were able to secure partnerships with a small number of media companies who had become specialized in capturing VR video early on, and we were off to the races.\\nOur initial excitement cooled off quickly. VR180 video quality on Oculus Go was decent but flat, washed out and far from amazing mostly due to low resolution. These videos didn\\u2019t create a true sense of presence, of feeling transported to another reality. And most of the content was of one-off nature, with no real franchises that would have people coming back for more (with the exception of sports, which failed initially for other reasons that I\\u2019ll come back to later).\\nWithin a year, the Oculus team pivoted to VR gaming and stopped investing in immersive video almost completely.\\nIn 2020, Apple acquired\\nNextVR\\n, one of the small but highly respected companies we had been working with as they were edging into bankruptcy (we passed on the acquisition at Meta/Oculus). NextVR had spent over a decade building and perfecting VR 180 camera technology and production pipelines for broadcast-quality video.\\nThe NextVR YouTube channel\\nis still live and provides amazing examples of what became possible with their technology\\n(make sure to pan around using your mouse/finger while watching videos in their YT channel)\\n.\\nThe latest publicly displayed NextVR 180-3D camera in 2018 (Source:\\nThe Verge\\n)\\nThe NextVR acquisition is what led to the incredible\\nApple Immersive\\nvideo format, which enables capture of\\n3D video in 180 degrees in 8K resolution at 90 frames per second\\n, an absolute juggernaut format with 8 times the number of pixels of a regular 4K video.\\nThe best way to think of the new\\nApple Immersive\\nvideo format is kind of like a new IMAX-3D\\n, but the real magic is the fact that it\\u2019s projected inside an imaginary 180-degree sphere (horizontally\\nand\\nvertically) that takes over your entire field of view.\\nVision Pro is the first VR headset that enables playback of 180-degree 3D video at what feels to the eyes like 4K quality. At launch, there are four Apple TV short films on Vision Pro shot in Apple Immersive video format. My absolute favorite of these films \\u2014\\nAdventure\\n\\u2014 is a jaw-dropping cinematic piece that is likely to win its share of movie awards. Experiencing the Norwegian fjords with this level of immersion is completely breathtaking, so much so that it might be my favorite experience so far in Vision Pro. I have never felt transported to another place in this manner in any experience I\\u2019ve ever had, anywhere, period.\\nAdventure\\nis one of the short films shot in Apple Immersive format released with the Vision Pro launch\\nMy second favorite Apple Immersive video \\u2014\\nAlicia Keys: Rehearsal Room\\n\\u2014 is a super fun and intimate concert that really makes you feel what presence in VR could be like with another human. While it\\u2019ll be fun for nearly everyone to see Alicia Keys in a close-up VR performance, it may not be nearly as happy and inspiring to see a human in close proximity in other situations.\\nMY TAKE:\\nThe super high-fidelity\\nApple Immersive\\nvideo format will run into an unexpected and significant \\u201cuncanny valley\\u201d challenge as a consequence of its\\nhyperrealism\\n. Seeing someone right in such close proximity to you and in such high fidelity may feel cool to one person but will feel uncomfortable or overwhelming to others. Less so in a scene like this intimate music concert or sports game, but probably a lot more so in dramatic storytelling and other types of more realistic films.\\nBack in the Oculus days, we used to run experiments to try and really understand which lines could not be crossed in VR content to avoid people feeling overwhelmed or even unsafe. One of the findings in these experiments was that too much realism and fidelity could be one of the things that crosses a line. In other words,\\nhyperrealism\\ncould quickly drag people into the\\nuncanny valley\\n, one of two places we always want to avoid in VR (the other place is motion sickness).\\nMany people will feel themselves crossing the uncanny valley while\\nwatching\\nAlicia Keys: Rehearsal Room\\non Vision Pro\\nNavigating this creative challenge will take time and a lot of experimentation on Apple\\u2019s side, and they\\u2019re the one company in the world we can trust to have the level of sensitivity and artistry for this journey, not to mention the ability to hire the best of the best talent. Practically, it probably means we can expect to see beautiful experiential films in Apple Immersive format exploring topics such as beautiful landscapes, wildlife, travel and music, but are less likely to see deep human storytelling with people in close proximity to the camera (which is typical of nearly all traditional filmmaking).\\nLuckily for Apple, there is one category where hyperrealism is much less likely to be an issue especially for hardcore fans \\u2014\\nLive Sports\\n.\\nLive sports\\nwill be Apple\\u2019s secret weapon to sell a huge number of Vision Pro headsets to hardcore fans \\u2014 but it\\u2019s going to be a long & expensive journey\\nOne of the original Oculus Go 30-second TV commercials featured an\\nNBA courtside banter between Adam Levine and Jonah Hill\\nwearing the Oculus headset while watching a live game together in VR (each sitting in their own physical living room):\\nScreenshot from an original\\nOculus Go\\nTV commercial (\\nfull video\\n)\\nThis TV commercial did extremely well, drove a significant amount of Oculus Go sales (after all, that headset only cost $199) and definitely showed that we were on to something potentially quite powerful with hardcore sports fans. But as I explained in the previous section, we did not manage to bring it to reality in a way that would meet expectations.\\nIn the end, our team at Oculus completely failed to realize the opportunity of redefining the sports audience experience through VR for a number of reasons, but primarily because we just didn\\u2019t have the patience to develop that market. We were unable to build the necessary industry support with sports leagues and broadcast rights holders initially, so we stopped trying and the VR sports segment nearly died. There are small efforts on Quest today such as\\nXtadium\\nand\\nMeta Horizons\\n, but the quality of the experience and the limited live content make it all too insignificant to matter. To date, nobody ever really tried hard enough to create this market.\\nApple has the opportunity to completely change this, for a few reasons:\\nApple Immersive on Vision Pro is a transformative experience\\nin terms of video quality and its ability to deliver a real sense of presence. Watching a game in high-resolution VR has the\\npotential\\nto be legitimately better than a regular 4K TV broadcast by enabling hardcore fans to feel much closer to the action.\\nApple has VR broadcast expertise\\nwith its acquisition of NextVR, and could have been painstakingly building a robust production pipeline for live 8K video, which is a tall technical challenge requiring non-trivial investment and specialized talent.\\nApple is already active in the sports broadcast rights world\\nthrough their existing MLS license and several other rumored conversations that may lead to Apple buying a lot more broadcast rights to continue to strengthen Apple TV (ex. English Premier League, Formula 1).\\nThe first place where Apple will likely explore using Apple Immersive and Vision Pro for a live broadcast is Major League Soccer in the US. Their recent announcement is a strong indicator this is likely coming in late 2024 or early 2025 (to continue building momentum for Vision Pro):\\nComing soon, all Apple Vision Pro users can experience the best of the 2023 MLS Cup Playoffs with\\nthe first-ever sports film captured in Apple Immersive Video\\n. Viewers will feel every heart-pounding moment in 8K 3D with a 180-degree field of view and Spatial Audio that transports them to each match.\\nApple Press Release \\u2013 February 2024\\nApple will likely use MLS as a testing ground for developing Apple Immersive live broadcasts\\nBeyond MLS (where Apple already has a long-term agreement and the ability to basically do anything), it will take a significant amount of time and money for Apple to strike the necessary agreements with the main sports leagues (NBA, NFL, MLB, Premier League etc) to enable this kind of immersive broadcast experience. That said, this is likely only a matter of time, as the opportunity to rethink audience sports is large enough that it would matter a lot even to a multi-trillion dollar company like Apple.\\nMY TAKE:\\nJust to put things in perspective, prices of tickets for watching live sports (in the actual venue) have been going steadily up and are now in the $100s even for average to bad seats, with premium tickets easily going into the $1000s (\\nthe cheapest SuperBowl ticket in 2024 was around $2,000 at face value\\n). The business case for a high-quality immersive \\u201ccourtside\\u201d experience on Vision Pro is almost unquestionably very strong.\\nThere are two major aspects Apple will have to nail in order to successfully monetize this opportunity, both of which will require a lot of design, engineering and experimentation:\\nLive sports are very social\\n, which means Apple will have to invest heavily in delivering a co-watching experience that works equally well for people who are physically in the same room or virtually co-located, and which feels as natural as casually watching a game sitting on the couch with your family or at a bar with your friends.\\nThe experience bar will be very high\\n, which means Apple will have to really customize every aspect of the experience to the nature of each sport to make it better than watching a game on a large 4K television \\u2014 including camera angles, special replays, birds-eye visualizations, analysis overlays, game stats etc.\\nThis is a massive canvas for innovation, and it will take several generations of Vision Pro to get there. I\\u2019m optimistic and, speaking from the position of having been part of a team that really tried to go after this opportunity, I really believe this is one of those things where \\u201cit takes an Apple\\u201d to change the game (pun very much intended!).\\nWatching live tennis on Xtadium app on Quest:\\nmultiple cameras to choose from\\nplus\\nsimultaneous TV broadcast on giant virtual floating screen\\nPGA app on Vision Pro:\\nbirds-eye view of a 3D model of the course and ability to track shots of a recorded prior match\\nConcept of a Formula 1 mixed reality broadcast by viz artist John LePore (Source:\\nYouTube\\n):\\nbirds-eye track view, main broadcast on giant floating screen, multi-camera access, live telemetry\\nConclusions\\nWhy I returned my Vision Pro, and my wish list for what Apple could do to fix & improve the product\\nAs a \\u201cproduct guy\\u201d, I usually force myself to behave like a real consumer making real trade-offs as much as I possibly can. I believe that always putting myself in the user\\u2019s shoes is an important part of what I do not just for my own products but also for products built by other people. I admit Vision Pro is the ultimate tech toy, but since I\\u2019m not an active developer I can\\u2019t justify the $4,049.78 price tag (512GB model + California sales tax) simply for keeping up with the VR market, so I returned my Vision Pro for a full refund inside the 14-day return window.\\nIn Apple\\u2019s journey of\\nproduct-market fit\\nin VR, the Vision Pro has a long way to be able to deliver true retention. Apple\\u2019s high-risk decision to completely exclude immersive VR games from the Vision Pro app store \\u2014\\nplus\\ntheir inexplicable failure to create exciting momentum by not having high-quality AR apps at launch \\u2014 don\\u2019t leave them with many options to deliver user value in the near term to non-developers.\\nThe only low-hanging fruit is to make productivity really good, which despite being incredibly unimaginative and dull, should be one of Apple\\u2019s biggest focus in the next iterations of visionOS. I don\\u2019t discard the possibility of once again owning a 1st-gen Vision Pro in the future once Apple addresses all of the friction issues I uncovered and shared above.\\nDuring the 2 weeks of my Vision Pro experience, I accumulated a very long list of bug fixes and feature requests based on 2 weeks of Vision Pro usage. I\\u2019m going to share my Top 10 here:\\nMake productivity use cases frictionless\\nfirst of all by closing the gap with developers to bring essential iPad apps to Vision Pro // fix text input & editing and make it seamless // add support for 2 (and ideally 3) MacOS remote displays // add workspace window persistency // build \\u201cspatial Mission Control\\u201d and enforce a minimal recommended focal distance\\nHave developers build amazing AR games\\nand do everything possible to set a really high quality bar & reward their creativity // add SharePlay support with\\nPersonas\\nand really push for multi-player support, enabling people to be\\nand\\nplay together.\\nImprove passthrough mode\\nto the extent that the hardware sensor stack allows, ideally reducing motion blur, improving white balance, and making seeing your hands more seamless (when viewing immersive content)\\nCreate workspace spatial persistency\\nand allow me to configure different rooms in my home or office in such a way that Vision Pro always remembers my room-specific configurations\\nMake 3D widgets & objects first-class citizens\\nin visionOS and enable people to decorate their homes & offices persistently\\nLet people bring their iPhone into VR\\nby simply looking at the device (like the MacOS virtual display feature) and then getting a floating panel that they can place anywhere in their space \\u2014 this will work wonders in reducing FOMO while in VR\\nAdd a\\nGuest mode\\nso anyone can give the Apple in-store demo\\nand make it possible for Vision Pro users to \\u201cspread the love\\u201d \\u2014 there\\u2019s nothing more magical than giving someone their first VR demo\\nAdd Persona support to SharePlay\\nfor watching video so people can actually feel like they\\u2019re together \\u2014 VR has a bad reputation of loneliness & isolation, so making VR social must be a priority even though few people will use social features at first. There aren\\u2019t enough people with Vision Pro for this to be a practical use case today, but it\\u2019s important for Apple to set the right tone.\\nLaunch tons of beautiful environments\\nideally with a steady frequency, taking a page out of the Apple TV screensaver playbook \\u2014 and include beautiful indoor environments as well (not just landscapes)\\n(Lastly\\u2026) Find a way to let people play immersive VR games\\nby implementing\\nOpenXR\\nsupport, forming a partnership with\\nSteamVR\\nor simply opening up visionOS a bit to allow VR developers and enthusiasts to build compatibility themselves\\nONE MORE THING: (1) Why Meta\\u2019s Android moment is finally here, (2) My unsolicited product advice for\\nQuest Pro 2\\nand beyond\\nAs I said at the beginning of this essay, while working at Meta/Oculus I used to semi-seriously joke that the best thing that could ever happen to us was having Apple enter the VR industry. One of the main reasons for me to say this was that I knew Apple would do the best job of any company making people really\\nwant\\nVR through its unparalleled brand, design and marketing. Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey puts it best:\\n\\u201cVR will become something everyone wants before it becomes something everyone can afford.\\u201d\\nPalmer Luckey, 2015 tweet\\nFor Meta, the Vision Pro launch is the best marketing tool for Quest VR that the company could have dreamed of but could have never achieved on its own, for a few reasons:\\nIt elevates VR to a level of mainstream consumer curiosity\\nand breaks away from gamer and VR enthusiast niches; in media coverage alone the Vision Pro probably had 1,000x more reach than any Oculus/Quest launch in history\\nIt sets a new experience gold standard for VR\\nespecially by pushing the existing boundaries in display resolution and creating a new paradigm of \\u201cUI magic\\u201d with gaze & pinch which may be an instant de facto standard\\nIt establishes a pricing envelope\\nthat enables Meta to break away from the $500 price point that Quest has been stuck in, and specifically allows them to ship a Quest Pro 2 headset priced at a $1,000 to $1,500 (but likely not higher) without being completely rejected by consumers\\nIt creates a formidable competitor\\nfor Meta teams to maniacally chase and will almost certainly force the company to move with a much greater sense of urgency internally (which would be a great outcome as friends on the inside are constantly complaining Meta Reality Labs moves too slowly)\\nWhat should Meta do in response to the Vision Pro launch?\\nIn order to really seize this moment and opportunity created by the Vision Pro launch, Meta would need to ship a VR headset by mid-2025 that both builds on the new experience gold standard created by the Vision Pro\\nand\\nis objectively a better product across as many dimensions as possible.\\nI put together my own\\nTop 10\\nwish list for\\nQuest Pro 2\\n:\\nDouble down investment in micro-OLED\\nas it\\u2019s likely the only way to achieve display resolution at or near Vision Pro; I suspect this may be exactly what the\\nrecently announced LG partnership\\nis about\\nBuild an ergonomic headset\\nthat can be worn for 2-4 hours\\nwithout causing any major discomfort issues; ideally offering two battery options: (1) a head-strap with a built-in battery in the back of the head, and (2) a wired pack (like the Vision Pro) that moves the battery off the head and reduces the headset weight to below 500 grams while increasing energy capacity.\\nDeliver better passthrough than Vision Pro\\nby dramatically improving Quest 3\\u2019s latency and distortion correction and improving upon all of the Vision Pro passthrough issues \\u2014 ensure no perceivable motion blur, high dynamic range, accurate white balance\\nTake Apple\\u2019s gaze+pinch UI to the next level\\nby productizing all of the amazing research on hand tracking done at Meta (ex: Rob Wang\\u2019s super talented group) to enable fine-grained gestures such as scrolling and D-pad selection by detecting small finger movements solely via camera input (this is\\nnot\\nthe CTRL Labs stack\\u2026 that\\u2019s for the future)\\nPartner with Microsoft to make Windows computers 1st class citizens\\nin Quest Pro 2 and enable advanced desktop productivity use cases that go well beyond virtual monitors (ex: make it possible to take any window and place it in space)\\nLaunch Android 2D tablet apps natively on Quest\\nto match the Vision Pro iPad compatibility library either by partnering with Google to license\\nPlay Store\\n(which\\nseems unlikely these days\\nthough I still believe Ash Jhaveri and Hiroshi could work together to pull it off) or just build a curated tablet app store directly (which we had considered in the past at Oculus but passed on)\\nLaunch human-like avatars with Quest Pro 2\\nby productizing Meta\\u2019s mind-blowing\\nCodec Avatars technology\\n, likely one of the VR research areas that has received the most R&D dollars for the last 7+ years, used by\\nLex Fridman in his interview with Mark Zuckerberg in late 2023\\nLaunch high-definition room scanning and unlock teleportation\\nusing technology that has existed within Oculus Research for several years now; it is time for Meta to make this future a reality where people can be remote but\\nfeel\\ntruly present by visiting each other\\u2019s home, office or favorite place\\nAppendix: Other Fun Things\\nDespite all of its hardware insanity the Vision Pro display is still a far cry from a VR retina display (and may never get there)\\nAs noted above the Vision Pro display delivers insane pixel density at over 3,000 PPI (compared to 500 PPI for the highest resolution smartphones), but because the panel is so close to our eyes, it still doesn\\u2019t come even close to the resolution it would need to have in order to qualify as a\\nretina display\\n.\\nA retina display, by\\nApple\\u2019s definition\\n, is a display with a high enough resolution that the human eye cannot resolve individual pixels. Because different devices are used at varying distances from the eye, there is no single PPI (pixels per inch) standard for retina across all device categories. Instead, it\\u2019s useful to look at PPD (pixels per degree), which is a measure of angular resolution independent of viewing distance, or specifically the number of horizontal pixels per degree of\\nviewing angle\\n. See\\nthis article from SimulaVR\\nfor an excellent explanation, and here\\u2019s an image from that article:\\nSource:\\nSimularVR\\nA human eye with 20/20 vision has a resolution of 60 PPD. This means very specifically that we can resolve 60 pixels per each 1 degree of viewing angle (or 1 pixel per arc minute, which is 1/60th of a degree). The Vision Pro has an angular resolution of 34, which is 1/3 more than the Meta Quest 3 but still very far away from the 60 PPD we\\u2019d need for a retina-quality display.\\nAchieving angular resolution anywhere near 60 PPD in a VR headset is likely not possible with any technology in the mid-term horizon.\\nShare this:\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nLike\\nLoading\\u2026\\nMarch 11, 2024\\nhbarra22\\nUncategorized\\napple\\n,\\napple-vision-pro\\n,\\ntechnology\\n,\\nvision-pro\\n,\\nvr\\n35 responses to \\u201cVision Pro is an over-engineered \\u201cdevkit\\u201d // Hardware bleeds genius & audacity but software story is disheartening // What we got wrong at Oculus that Apple got right // Why Meta could finally have its Android\\u00a0moment\\u201d\\nShameer Mulji\\nsays:\\nMarch 13, 2024 at 11:22 am\\nA great and informative article.\\u2002Regarding this point:\\n\\u201cThis also opens an extremely interesting path for Apple in a few years to\\nuse an iPhone, iPad or MacBook as the tethered computer driving the headset\\n\\u201c\\nI actually think Apple should have led with this right from day one.\\nLike\\nLike\\nReply\\nhbarra22\\nsays:\\nMarch 13, 2024 at 3:38 pm\\nThat was also our prediction at Oculus back in the day when my colleagues and I tried to reason from Apple\\u2019s perspective to predict what their first VR headset would be like. I suspect the decision to pack all compute in the headset was partly a matter of practicality to keep the full product experience under control of the same team, but it was largely dictated by the need to have a very low-latency, real-time data pipeline to ensure passthrough was flawless (which led to the R1 chip). I think Apple has a lot of work to do to incorporate that tech into an iPad or iPhone, so it\\u2019ll be a few years out.\\nLike\\nLike\\nReply\\nEvan Zimmerman\\nsays:\\nMarch 13, 2024 at 12:55 pm\\nI loved this.

That\\u2019s my biggest barrier in buying it. I also think sharing what you\\u2019re viewing with people in the same room is really missing.

While the Office suite is available on Mac, the absence of familiar shortcuts renders the experience subpar and frankly, impractical. Despite Apple\\u2019s efforts to make Office apps accessible on the Vision Pro, using them feels akin to texting on your phone through a pass-through.\\nDespite these challenges, I\\u2019ve discovered a valuable use case for the Vision Pro,  Teams sessions when content sharing is involved.
